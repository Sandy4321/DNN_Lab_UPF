      Title: "FOOLPROOF" SOURDOUGH STARTER
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 999 Servings
 
      1 c  Yogurt
      1 c  Milk
           -skim, reg or buttermilk
      1 c  Flour
 
  Mix the milk and yogurt together in a glass, pottery or plastic
  container.(NOT metal) Keep a lid on it, but don't seal it. (sealed
  starters have been known to explode!)  Put this where the temperature
  will be 80-90F for about 24 hours.  Then add the flour and put it
  back in the warm place for 3-5 days. Stir it daily.  It will bubble
  and have the odor of fermentation. It's ready to use.
  
  A starter is a live thing and must be fed.  When you use it you should
  replace what you used.  The amount you should replace will vary
  according to need. If you use your starter often or you know you are
  going to have a heavy demand soon, then you can put several cups of
  milk and flour (equal measures) in it. Generally though you should
  put in either 1/2 C to 1 C of both flour and milk.  I prefer to use
  buttermilk, as it gives the starter a much stronger sour taste.  If
  you are not going to use the starter for awhile, place it in the
  refrigerator. It needs to be fed once a week...just a few spoons
  flour or milk. If you forget and leave it in there for a long time
  without food, don't just throw it out. Try first to bring it back by
  adding 1/2c of flour and milk and leave out for a day or so.  It is
  remarkable how these things come back.

      1 c  Butter: double weight 200 gm
  2 3/4 c  Flour: triple weight 300 gm
      1    Egg yolk

           Cocoa or melted choclate
           Ground almonds
 
  Translated Meurbeteig means " mellow dough ." The basic method for
  this versatile dough which can be made into many variations starts
  with the principle of : one part weight sugar, double weight butter
  and triple weight flour.The cup amounts above are approximates. Just
  weigh ingredients for the most accurate measurements. Combine the
  flour, butter and sugar and stir in enough egg yolk with vanilla,
  wine, and lemon to taste to bind the dough. The dough can be made
  batter like, softer or firmer as desired. this is the outstanding
  feature of this dough to change it to your liking. For kuchens the
  dough can be made into a texture to spread or pat into the pan.
  although normally no baking powder is used, a teaspoon made be added
  for kuchen type doughs.Normally the dough is like a short dough
  similar to tart pastry.Basically for softer doughs, increase the egg
  yolks and decrease the flour. for chocolate variations add some
  baking cocoa or melted chocolate. For a tangy dough add some sour
  cream, or grated cheese for a cheese pastry dough. blend in almonds
  for a nut dough. Of importance is that the dough should be prepared
  quickly  and chilled prior to using if used for tart shells or
  pastries.Then it can be rolled out to fit tart pans etc.Prick the
  dough with tines of a fork when used for tart pastries. For kuchens
  the dough need not be chilled and may be used immediately. Double

    3/4 c  Sugar; granulated
      1 tb Orange rind; finely grated
 
  James Beard's 1-2-3-4 Layer Cake; Uses three 9x1/2 inch deep cake
  pans. Makes: One 3-layered cake; Serves 12 depending on thickness of
  slices. *Note:1. If you can't find cake flour, the same amount of
  All-purpose flour can be substituted. * Directions * Preheat the oven
  to 350dF. Using your hands, butter the bottom and sides of all 3
  layer-cake pans with softened butter; sprinkle flour inside, then
  shake pans so you get a thin coating on the butter. Tip out any
  excess! Now to sift your flour. Lay a large piece of waxed paper on a
  board, put a dry measuring cup in the center, hold a sifter directly
  over it, scoop cake flour from the package into the sifter, and sift
  the flour directly into the cup. When the cup is full, draw the back
  of a knife blade lightly across the top of the cup (don't shake the
  flour down, or it will become dense) and then tip the measured flour
  into a mixing bowl. Repeat with the other 2 cups of flour (you can
  put any flour that spilled onto the waxed paper back in the sifter).
  When you have 3 cups of sifted flour in the bowl, put the baking
  powder and salt in the sifter, holding it over the mixing bowl, and
  sift it over the flour. Then, still using your hands, mix the baking
  powder and salt lightly with the flour. Next, put the butter into a
  second, large mixing bowl. If it is very firm (it shouldn't be, if
  you have left it out of the fridge), squeeze it through your fingers
  until it softens up. When it is soft enough to work, form your right
  hand into a big fork, as it were, and cream the butter. This means
  that you beat it firmly and quickly with your hand, beating and
  aerating it, until it becomes light, creamy and fluffy. Then whirl
  your fingers around like a whisk so the butter forms a circle in the
  bowl. Gradually cream the 2 cups of sugar into the butter with the
  same fork-like motion, beating until the mixture is very light and
  fluffy. As the sugar blends in it will change the color of the butter
  to a much lighter color, almost white. Now wash and dry your hands
  thoroughly. Separate the eggs as you would for a souffle', letting
  the whites slip though slightly parted fingers into a small bowl and
  dropping the yokes into a second, larger bowl. Beat the yokes for a
  few minutes with a whisk until they are well blended. Then, again
  with your hand, beat them very thoroughly into the butter-sugar
  mixture. Now beat in the milk alternately with the sifted flour --
  first one, then the other -- this time keeping your fingers close
  together as if your hand were a wooden spatula. Beat, beat, beat
  until the batter is well mixed, then add the vanilla and beat that in
  for 1 or 2 minutes. Put the egg whites in your beating bowl and beat
  them with a large whisk or and electric hand beater until they mount
  first to soft, drooping peaks and then to firm, glossy peaks. Do not
  over beat so that they are stiff and dry! Tip the beaten whites onto
  the cake batter and fold them in with your hand. Slightly cup your
  hand and use the side like a spatula to cut down through the whites
  and batter to the bottom of the bowl and then flop them over with
  your cupped hand, rotating the bowl with your other hand as you do so
  ~- exactly the technique used when folding egg whites into a souffle
  mixture with a rubber spatula. Repeat this very lightly and quickly
  until the whites and batter are thoroughly folded and blended. Once
  you have mastered this hand technique you can use it for souffles.
  Again using your hand like a spatula, pour and scrape the batter into
  three prepared pans, dividing it equally between them. Give the
  filled pans a little knock on the countertop to level the batter. Put
  the 3 pans in the center of the oven, or, if you have to use more
  than 1 rack, stagger them on the 2 middle racks of the oven so they
  do not overlap. Bake for 25 minutes, then touch the center of each
  cake lightly with your fingertip. If it springs back, it is done.
  Remove the pans and put them on wire cake rakes to cool for a few
  minutes, then loosen the layers by running the flat of a knife blade
  around the sides of the pans, put a rack on top of each pan, and
  invert so the cake comes out onto the rack, top side down. Then
  reverse the layers so they are top side up. For filling and icing,
  SEE: 1-2-3-4 Filling and Icing recipe.

 Categories: Icing
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
MMMMM-------------------FOR FILLING AND ICING------------------------
    3/4 c  Orange juice; strained
      2 tb Lemon juice
    3/4 c  Sugar; granulated
      1 tb Orange rind; finely grated
 
  Makes: Icing and filling for one cake. SEE: Cake, 1-2-3-4 Cake by
  James Beard for the cake recipe.
  :       Mix the orange juice, lemon juice, sugar and orange rind
  together and drizzle the mixture over the three still warm cake
  layers. Be careful not to let it all soak into one spot.
  :       Then pile the layers on top of each other. The juice mixture
  will give the cake a lovely, fresh, fruity flavor and it is not rich
  like a chocolate or other candy flavored icing. Leave the cake to
  cool.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      3 tb Dark brown sugar
    3/4 c  Warm water (105F-115F)
  2 3/4 c  Whole-wheat flour
      3 tb Nonfat dry milk powder
      3 tb Vegetable oil
      1 lg Egg; -=OR=-
      2 lg Egg whites
      1 ts Salt
 
  STIR YEAST AND SUGAR into water; let stand until foamy, about 5
  minutes. For food processor fitted with metal blade or mixer with
  dough hook, put flour, milk powder, oil and egg or egg whites into
  bowl. Turn machine on and combine mixture. With machine running,
  slowly add yeast mixture. Mix until dough cleans sides of bowl. If
  dough is too sticky, add more flour by the tablespoon, working it in
  before adding more. If dough is crumbly and dry, add more water by
  the teaspoon, working it in before adding more. Once desired
  consistency is reached (moist but not sticky), mix dough until well
  kneaded, uniformly supple and elastic, about 40 seconds in food
  processor, about 6 minutes in mixer. If mixing by hand, put
  ingredients in large bowl. Mix well. Make well in center, pour in
  yeast mixture and work into ingredients, then knead on floured board
  until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Transfer dough to large
  plastic bag, squeeze out air and seal at top. Place dough in bowl.
  Let rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. Oil a baking
  sheet. Punch dough down and shape into smooth ball. Place smooth side
  up on baking sheet. Cover loosely with oiled plastic. Let rise in
  warm spot until doubled, about 40-50 minutes. Preheat oven to 375F.
  Fifteen minutes before baking, put rack in center of oven; dust dough
  top lightly with flour. Make a decorative slash across the top. Bake
  until bread is well browned and sounds hollow when rapped on bottom,
  about 30-35 minutes. Immediately remove from pan and cool on rack.

           - bouillon
      1 lg White or yellow onion cut
           - into 8th's
      2    Stalks celery with tops
           - cut into sections
    1/4    Bell pepper
      1    Clove garlic peeled & sliced
      1 ts Heaping thyme
    1/4 ts Sage
      1    Pinch rosemary
      1    Small bay leaf
           Crushed peppercorns to taste
           Salt to taste (none with
           - bouillon)
    1/2 ts Dijon mustard
           Dry white wine or for change
           -try dry sherry
    1/2 lb Sweet cream butter (adjust
           - salt if salted butter is
           - used)
 
  UTENSILS: 2 qt. sauce pan Colander or large strainer measuring cups
  and spoons food processor, mixer or blender (use your hands only if
  slightly Masochistic) Pate molds or buttered 9" cake pan with release
  or a bowl
  
  PREPARATION: In sauce pan, combine livers, stock, spices, garlic,
  celery, onion, pepper & salt. Add enough wine to just cover
  ingredients and bring to boiling point. Reduce heat, cover, and
  simmer for about 1/2 hour. When done, place contents in the colander.
  Reserve the wine broth and allow it to stand and cool. Discard the
  bayleaf from the contents in the colander and allow remainder to cool
  for 1/2 hour.
  
  Gently ladel off the wine broth until the liquid containing the
  sediment equals 2/3 cup. Save the clear broth in case you need more.
  Be sure to catch all the sediment because it is an important part of
  the recipe.
  
  In your food processor; combine the contents of the colander, sediment
  broth, butter, mustard and 1/2 of the crumbled bacon. Process until
  the mixture is a smooth, soupy puree. Fold in remaining bacon and
  pour into final mold. If it is too thick to pour, you need to add
  more broth. Allow pate to set in refrigerator for at least 24 hours.
  
  Unmold, lightly sprinkle with cracked peppercorns and garnish with
  sliced olives and parsley.
  
  This recipe is an antique French farm recipe reported to be over 100
  years old. It is a classic recipe with wonderful spices and subtle
  flavors.

  * Experiment with unsalted seeds for different taste and texture; try
  equal amounts of pumpkin seeds, flax seeds and sunflower seeds.
  
  For best results, use the "extra knead" process and add seeds near
  the end of the first knead.
  
  Gluten is available in health food stores & nutritional departments.

 Categories: Digest, Sept., Abm
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/8 c  Water
      3 c  Whole Wheat Flour
      3 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Active Dry Yeast
 
  This is pretty heavy bread, but I like it that way. For a better
  raise, try adding 1/3 cup of gluten, and you may need a bit more
  water, then.
  
  Use Whole Wheat mode. Timer ok.
  
  Note: Whole wheat varies greatly in how much water it absorbs. The
  amounts of water shown are the ones that work for me. Check on the
  dough after the first few minutes of kneading. If it is too thin, add
  flour, 1 T at the time. If the dough is too dry and does not form a
  smooth ball, add water, 1 T at the time. Since bread machines can
  handle relatively moist do, it is better to err on the moist side
  (which will result in heavier bread, if it is much too much).

  The trick to making 100% whole wheat bread in your machine is an extra
  knead, which gives the yeast and gluten a second chance to create a
  lighter loaf.  When your first knead cycle is completed, simply reset
  the machine and start again - or use the whole wheat cycle, if it's
  available on your machine.
  
                               Success Hints
                               -------------
  
  If your market doesn't stock wheat gluten, try your local health food
  store.
  
  Remember the extra knead (as usual for wheat bread) - it's especially
  important for 100% whole wheat bread! You should use only the regular
  bake cycle.

  The trick to making 100% whole wheat bread in your machine is an extra
  knead, which gives the yeast and gluten a second chance to create a
  lighter loaf.  When your first knead cycle is completed, simply reset
  the machine and start again.  Some manufacturers produce home
  bakeries with a whole wheat cycle; if your machine doesn't have one,
  this start- again method works as an easy alternative. SUCCESS HINTS:
  The gluten gives the whole wheat flour the structure necessary for a
  good loaf. If your market doesn't stock wheat gluten, try your local
  health food store. Remember the extra knead.  It's especially
  important in 100% whole wheat bread. Because of the extra knead, us
  this recipe only on the regular bake cycle. CALORIES: 125 PROTEIN:

      2 c  Confectioners' sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla
           Chopped pistachio nuts
           For garnish
 
  Preparation time: 45 minutes Baking time: 16 minutes
  
    1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. For cookies, sift flour, sugar and

  center of each cookie. Bake about 8 minutes; remove from oven. Dent
  again and bake about 8 minutes longer; cool.
    3. For frosting, blend 6 tablespoons butter, half-and-half and brown
  sugar in saucepan. Boil 2 minutes, stirring constantly; remove from
  heat. Cool about 15 minutes, then stir in confectioners' sugar and
  vanilla. Beat until smooth and thick.
    4. Fill depressions in cookies with butterscotch frosting and
  sprinkle frosting with nuts.
    Winner Penney L. Haney of Kenosha described these cookies: "Oh, the
  aroma! Dad knew his 'girls' had been baking as soon as he stepped in
  the back door, brushing snowflakes from his coat. He warmed his hands
  over the hot oven, slowly recovering feeling in his fingertips, numb
  from stringing red, yellow, blue, green and white lights in the pines
  in the yard. His chore and our special treat combined each year to
  mark the beginning of our holiday preparations.
    "While chatting to Mom about trying to locate the single,
  burned-out bulb that had kept an entire strand out, he watched me,
  his tiny daughter, with not so dexterous fingers, shaping dough into
  big marbles. I had to kneel on a wooden chair to reach the table,
  with Mom's brightly-colored apron wrapped around me nearly twice,
  held together in back by a giant safety pin." from the Chicago

    Winner Donna M. Farrell of Naperville entered her chocolate covered
  cherry cookie recipe: "Christmas and chocolate-covered cherries are
  forever entwined in my mind and memories. Not the expensive
  department store kind, mind you, with their dark bitter chocolate and
  runny syrup, but your basic Brach's. Each Christmas found the coveted
  white box stretching my stocking, two layers of cream-filled heaven
  with a cherry floating therein--and no requirement to share them with
  anyone.
    "Taste and calories have kept me away from the box of delights for
  many years, even after the incredible discovery that Brach's actually
  sold these morsels all year long. (How my parents managed to deceive
  me on this, I'll never know.) That is, until my mother-in-law came to
  Chicago one autumn with the ultimate cookie. A Christmas tradition in
  one bite. Nostalgia from the oven. Capable of reducing this
  36-year-old woman's taste buds and mentality to that of my 9-year-old

  during the time between Christmas and Epiphany. Great-Aunt Elizabeth
  came from a family whose women had been cooks for a wealthy family in
  Hungary. As a result, her cooking was usually slightly different and
  somewhat elegant.
    "A treasured memory of Christmas at Great-Aunt Elizabeth's house
  was a cookie that I never learned to eat in moderation. Although my
  mother warned me not to say anything, one of the first things I would
  say upon arrival was, 'I'm hungry,' hoping that these cookies would
  appear. Much to my delight they usually did, and in fact, began also

    Winner Jean McGree of Flossmoor "bores everyone," she says, with
  this family tale of Christmas praline cookies: "Since the time Mom
  had been a little girl, each November Grandma would surround her back
  yard pecan tree with sheets to catch the falling nuts. But most of
  the nuts had to be knocked from the branches with her long-handled
  broom. Then she would spend hours stooped over those sheets, picking
  up the pecans and sorting the good ones from the black and hollow
  shells.
    "When her daughter married and moved away, the nuts were carefully
  picked over, packaged and shipped 'up North.' Free time in the first
  week of December was always marked for shelling the pecans. Sore
  hands and stiff backs were repaid with secret nibbling and promises
  of praline cookies for Christmas.
    "Soon, I'll start looking for a package from Great-Grandma in South
  Carolina. Then, as we crack the pecans, I can retell the 'pecan
  story' to Michael and Ann, who know that Santa always looks for
  pralines on Christmas Eve." from the Chicago Tribune annual Food

  add flour and mix well. Chill dough until firm, several hours (it is
  hard to roll out otherwise).
    2. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Roll out dough on a floured board to
  about 1/8- inch thick. Cut into desired shapes with a flour-dipped
  cookie cutter. Place on ungreased or lightly greased cookie sheet.
    3. Decorate with colored sugar and chocolate sprinkles and use
  raisins or chocolate chips for the eyes of the animals. Bake for 5-7
  minutes or until a little brown. Cool on racks. Don't forget to cut
  the little holes if you wish  to hang on the tree.
    Note: Dough will keep several days or a week in the refrigerator if
  you don't get around to cutting right away. I store the cookies in

  don't find them.

  cutters that were not animals. We would cut small pieces of paper
  drinking straws and insert them in the top of each cookie and then
  bake them. The little piece of  straw was removed just as the cookies
  came from the oven, leaving a perfect little hole to put a colored
  string through so the cookie could be hung on our huge Christmas tree.
    "My sister and I would always make sure lots of the cookies were
  hung around the back of the tree. The tree was in the corner of the
  living room leaving a space behind, where we could crawl in. A
  favorite pastime during the holiday season was to lie on the floor
  behind the tree and using no hands, take tasty bites of the cookies,
  leaving behind the empty strings decorating the tree. Grandma would
  always pretend anger when she 'discovered' the empty strings and no
  cookie. It was a good game." from the Chicago Tribune annual Food
  Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 4, 1986

    Faye Kuhn, of Earlville, Illinois, recalled growing up in the tough
  times of the '40s: "Despite the lack of finances, no holiday was ever
  ignored in our household. Christmas, however, held the highest of
  honors. . . We all boarded the train and off to the city we would go.
  We would arrive home loaded with 'Evening in Paris' cologne, mittens,
  socks, handkerchiefs and coloring books bought at Kresge's and
  Woolworth's. Mom would then visit the local A & P for turkey,
  cranberries, sweet potatoes, fresh ground coffee, nuts, apples,
  oranges and one pound of butter to baste ol' Tom with. However, there
  was one thing my mother didn't do in those days and that was to bake
  Christmas cookies, for neither time nor money allowed such a luxury."
  But when her mother retired, she started baking Christmas cookies,
  Kuhn recalls. The family wanted her to make the thumbprints, yet no
  one knew the name or the recipe. "Mother put on her coat, crossed our
  back yard and knocked on our neighbor's door. She returned somewhat
  later, victorious, with recipe card in hand." from the Chicago

      Title: 1988 2ND PLACE: PAT EGAN'S CHRISTMAS TREE COO
 Categories: Cookies, Holiday
      Yield: 72 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Butter or margarine,
           Softened
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Almond extract
      1 ea Egg
    1/4 c  Green sugar crystals, about
    1/4 c  Confetti or nonpareil candy
           Decorations, optional
 
   Preparation time: 20 minutes Chilling time: 4 hours Baking time: 10
  minutes
  
    1. Put flour, sugar, butter, baking powder, salt, almond extract
  and egg into large bowl of an electric mixer. Mix together, using low
  speed. Dough will be crumbly. Then knead dough with hands until
  mixture holds together.
  
    2. Remove 1/3 cup of the dough; wrap and refrigerate. Divide
  remaining dough in thirds. Using hands, roll each into a 6-inch log.
  
    3. Put sugar crystals on a sheet of wax paper. Roll each log in the
  sugar crystals to coat well; use the wax paper as a guide to press in
  crystals. Shape each log into a triangle, pressing gently on wax
  paper to give three sharp corners. Make sure to make 2 sides longer
  than the third side. Wrap each log well and refrigerate at least 4
  hours or until dough is firm enough to slice. To this point, cookies
  can be made up to a week in advance.
  
    4. Heat oven to 350 degrees. To bake, slice logs crosswise into
  1/4-inch slices. Put slices about 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie
  sheets. For each cookie, shape about 1/2 teaspoon of the reserved 1/3
  cup dough into a tree trunk. Attach to bottom underside of each tree.
  Sprinkle each cookie lightly with candy decorations, if desired. Bake
  until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Carefully remove to wire
  racks. Cool completely.
  
    Note: The logs can be divided and shaped into 3 sizes and sliced to
  form a 3-tiered tree.   These second-place winning cookies are easily
  shaped into trees that are edged with glittery green sugar.
    Of her simple cookies, Pat Egan of Dolton, Illinois writes,
  "They're not a fancy or gourmet cookie, but a simple symbol of the

 Categories: Cookies, Holiday
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      1 c  Corn oil margarine
      1 c  Molasses
      1 c  Sugar
      1 ea Egg
      4 c  Flour
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
      3 ts Ground cinnamon
      2 ts Ground cloves
      2 ts Ground ginger
      1 ts Ground nutmeg
           Currants, raisins, silver
           Balls and candy,
           For decoration
      1 ea Egg yolk mixed w/1 ts water
           Icing for decorating
 
   Preparation time: 25 minutes Chilling time: 8 hours or overnight
  Baking time: 7 to 10 minutes
  
    1. Beat margarine, sugar and molasses in a large mixing bowl. Add
  egg and mix well.
    2. Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon,
  cloves, ginger and nutmeg. Add to butter mixture; mix well.
    3. Divide dough into 4 equal portions on a large piece of plastic
  wrap. Wrap and shape into a flat disk about 1 inch thick. Refrigerate
  until firm, about 8 hours, or freeze for 2 hours. (Dough can be
  refrigerated up to 3 days.)
    4. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Working with 1 disk of the dough at a
  time, roll out on a well-floured board, dusting the rolling pin as
  you work. Dough will be very soft and can be difficult to work with
  so work quickly and use plenty of flour. Using cookie cutters dipped
  in flour, cut into desired shapes. Put cookies 1 inch apart on an
  ungreased cookie sheet. Use currants or candy for eyes or buttons, if
  desired.
    5. Bake until lightly puffed, 7 to 10 minutes. First batch may be
  puffier because they will have less flour rolled in them. While still
  warm, paint with egg yolk wash if desired. Cool on wire racks. Cool
  completely, then decorate as desired with icing.
    Icing: Mix confectioners' sugar with a small amount of water until
  thick and spreading consistency. Add food coloring if desired and put
  in a small plastic bag. Cut a small hole in one corner and drizzle
  icing out onto the cooled cookies.
    Note: A 4-inch gingerbread cookie cutter was used in testing.
    Oak Brook's Gloria Heeter is a newcomer to the Chicago area and
  brings her favorite gingerbread cookie with her from Kansas City,
  Kan. "About nine years ago, my neighbor, Diane Collins, brought them
  over for Halloween in Halloween shapes," she says. "I took out some
  of the egg yolks and substituted corn oil margarine rather than
  shortening, which sometimes can have palm oil in it." Calling them
  "truly a cookie for all seasons," Heeter once even made them for her
  golden retriever's first birthday party. "We invited the neighborhood
  kids in for punch and cookies-cookies shaped like dogbones."    At
  Christmas, though, "I typically print the names of each person on the
  cookies, place them in a plastic bag and decorate them with a red and
  green ribbon," writes Heeter of her personalized gingerbread people.

  Ann Smith of Plainfield won second place, and described how her
  gingerbread men left Bohemia in 1872 and immigrated to the United
  States. Smith's great-grandmother, "Babicka" Novak, lived in a small
  Czech-American town in South Dakota where Smith's mother grew up in
  the 1920s. At Christmas time, her great-grandma would give her
  neighbors Old World gingerbread men, reindeer and rocking horses.
    "One year when Great-grandma delivered the cookies, she brought
  along her teenaged grandson, who was visiting from a small ethnic
  Czech community in Nebraska," Smith wrote.
    "Introductions made that day over the watchful eyes of the
  gingerbread men eventually lead to wedding bells for my parents a
  decade later. Great-grandma Novak probably had planned this all
  along!" from the Chicago Tribune second annual Food Guide Holiday

  cream cheese frosting and decorated in traditional holiday colors.
  The recipe, Rullo wrote, was one that her mother had found in her
  mother's first cookbook. As children, Rullo and her brother would
  help cut out the Santa Claus shapes and watch them bake. from the

      Title: 1990 3RD PLACE: SHORTBREAD SHEEP
 Categories: Cookies, Holiday
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      2 c  Unsalted softened butter
      1 c  Sugar
      4 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  Preparation time: 25 minutes Cooking time: 20 to 25 minutes
  
   1. Cream butter and sugar in large mixer bowl until light and
  fluffy. Beat in flour and salt. Knead the dough briefly until smooth.
  If dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour. (Dough can be
  refrigerated up to several days; soften slightly before shaping
  cookies.)
  
   2. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready.
  
   3. Pat half of the dough out on lightly floured surface to 1/2 -inch
  thickness. Use cookie cutters to cut out desired shapes. Place
  cookies 2 inches apart on baking sheets. Bake until light brown on
  edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on wire racks.
   Note: The sheep cookie cutter used by Koenig is a Hallmark cutter
  that is no longer available. A sheep pattern can be made out of
  cardboard and placed over dough; cut out the shape with a small knife.
  
   Third prize went to Betty J. Koenig, of Hammond, Ind., for her
  recipe for shortbread cookies in the shape of sheep. Betty uses a
  sheep cookie cutter to make these cookies. She suggests using your
  fingertips to dimple the dough to resemble their wooly coats. If
  desired, a small piece of chocolate can be used for eyes after
  baking. Chicago Tribune, December 13, 1990 from the Chicago Tribune

           Brown sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
  1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Baking powder
     12 oz Semisweet chocolate chips

           25 to 30 caramels, cut in
           Half, rolled into balls
           Finely chopped pecans
 
  Preparation time: 50 minutes Cooking time: 15 minutes
  
   1. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready.
  
   2. Cream butter, sugar and vanilla in large mixer bowl until
  well-mixed. Stir in flour and baking powder. (If kitchen is warm,
  refrigerate dough for a few minutes; dough should be firm enough to
  roll easily.) Shape scant teaspoonsful of dough into balls about the
  size of a marble. Place on baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches
  between cookies. Flatten slightly.
  
   3. Bake until golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to
  cool.
  
   4. Melt chocolate chips with shortening in top of double boiler set
  over simmering water. Remove from heat.
  
   5. Flatten caramel halves so they are the same diameter as the
  cookie. Put one caramel half on top of each cookie. (If necessary,
  use a dab of chocolate as "glue" to help caramel adhere to cookie.)
  Using a small metal spatula, spread melted chocolate thinly over top
  and sides of caramel and cookie to cover. Press chopped pecans onto
  tops of cookies. Let stand on a wire rack until chocolate firms
  (refrigerate if desired), about 20 minutes. Put into individual paper
  wrappers. Store in a cookie tin with a piece of wax paper between
  each layer.
  
   The first-place winner of the Tribune's 1991 Holiday Cookie Contest
  is Elaine Rysner. She prefers to make the cookies small - about the
  diameter of a quarter. Use high-quality caramels and chocolate for
  the best cookies. from the Chicago Tribune fourth annual Food Guide

    1/2 lb Unblanched almonds, finely
           Ground or grated
           Colored sugars for garnish,
           Optional
 
  Preparation time: 30 minutes Chilling time: 8 hours or overnight
  Cooking time: 10 minutes
  
   1. Cream butter and sugar in large mixer bowl of electric mixer.
  Beat in eggs, one at a time. Beat in lemon rind and juice. Mix flour,
  baking powder and salt. Stir flour mixture and ground almonds into
  butter mixture to make a soft dough. Divide dough into quarters.
  Refrigerate dough, wrapped in wax paper, until firm, at least 8 hours
  or overnight.
  
   2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready.
  
   3. Roll out one dough portion on lightly floured pastry cloth with a
  rolling pin covered with stocking or roll between sheets of lightly
  floured wax paper to 1/8 -inch thickness. Cut out with cookie
  cutters. Return dough to refrigerator if it gets too soft. Transfer
  to baking sheets, leaving 2 inches between each cookie. Sprinkle with
  colored sugar if desired.
  
   4. Bake until very light brown at edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer
  to wire racks to cool. Store in a covered tin.
  
   This second-place winner, from Judy M. Drux of Dyer, Indiana, makes
  very thin, crisp, delicate cookies. The dough keeps well in the
  refrigerator if well-wrapped. This cookie was a tribute to her
  husband's grandmother, Antonia Drux, who emigrated to this country
  from Germany in 1923. (Oma means "grandma" in German.) The recipe has
  been passed down as just a list of ingredients. Drux added a few

      1 tb Ground ginger
      2 ts Cinnamon
      2 ts Ground cloves

      4 c  All-purpose flour
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda
           Liquid food coloring,
           If desired
 
   Preparation time: 1 1/2 hours Chilling time: 12 hours or more Cooking
  time: 7 minutes
  
   1. Put sugar, syrup, water, ginger, cinnamon and cloves into a large
  saucepan. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture boils and sugar
  dissolves. Remove from heat. Add butter. Stir until butter is melted
  and mixture is no longer very hot.
  
   2. Mix flour and baking soda. Gradually add flour mixture to butter
  mixture and stir to blend thoroughly. Dough will have a soft texture.
  Place dough in an airtight container and refrigerate overnight or at
  least 12 hours or as long as 1 week.
  
   3. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Remove about one-sixth of the dough and
  knead it until it is slightly softened. Roll dough directly onto
  ungreased cookie sheets until it is about 1/4-inch thick. Use a
  cookie cutter to stamp shapes in dough, allowing a 1-inch margin
  between each cookie. Remove excess dough by lifting it and peeling it
  away. Scraps of dough can be kneaded together and re-rolled.
  
   4. Bake until golden brown, about 7 minutes. Allow cookies to cool
  slightly and become crisp before removing them from the cookie sheet.
  Cool thoroughly on wire racks. If desired, you may "paint" the cooled
  cookies using a clean, small paintbrush and food coloring that has
  been watered down slightly. Store cookies in airtight containers.
    Note: After the 12-hour resting period, this cookie dough can be
  hand-molded like clay--rolled, pinched, poked and pressed--and it
  will keep its shape, expanding slightly while baking. Thin cookies
  will become brown and bake quickly, large and thick shapes will
  require longer baking. Can be cut into any shape desired but make the
  cookies uniformly thick. The microwave oven can be used to cook the
  sugar mixture in step 1.

     12 oz Apricot preserves
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 tb Rum
           Confectioners' sugar
 
   Preparation time: 1 1/4 hours Cooking time: 10 to 12 minutes
  
   1. Sift flour into a large mixing bowl and make an indentation or
  well in the center of the flour. Add the sugar, egg yolks, vanilla,
  salt and lemon rind to the well. Mix the ingredients in the well
  together with the flour. Then cut in the butter using a pastry cutter
  or two sharp knives. At this point the dough will resemble coarse
  crumbs. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead it with your
  hands until smooth and firm. Divide dough in half and shape into two
  balls.
  
   2. Wrap tightly in plastic. Refrigerate until firm enough to roll
  out, about 1 hour.
  
   3. Meanwhile, heat the apricot preserves over low heat, stirring
  constantly. Stir in lemon juice and rum. Let cool.
  
   4. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Place the chilled dough on a lightly
  floured surface or between two sheets of floured wax paper. Roll out
  with a floured rolling pin to about 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out
  circles of dough about 2 inches in diameter. Place half of the
  circles onto greased or non-stick cookie sheets. Cut the other half
  of the circles again with a small shot glass or cookie cutter to form
  a ring shape. (Make an equal amount of rings to circles.) Place the
  rings onto buttered baking sheets. Bake until light gold, 10 to 12
  minutes. Cool a little on the cookie sheets.
  
   5. To assemble, brush the still-warm circles with the cooled apricot
  mixture. Place one ring on top of each circle and press gently (they
  break easily) to secure. Spoon a small dollop of the apricot mixture
  into the center of the cookies. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
  Cool. Store in a tightly closed tin.
  
  Infused with bits of lemon and pure vanilla and filled with apricot
  preserves and rum, the buttery rounds brought second-place honors to
  their baker, German-born Anne Kroemer of Chicago. Anne uses a wine
  glass and a smaller schnapps glass to cut out these cookies. We've
  made them slightly smaller by using round cookie cutters; biscuit

      Title: 1993 3RD PLACE: SPRINGERLE
 Categories: Cookies, Holiday
      Yield: 84 Servings
 
    1/2 ts Baker's ammonia
      2 tb Milk
      6 ea Eggs, at room temperature
  1 1/2 lb Confectioners' sugar
           (about 6 cups)
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter, softened
    1/2 ts Anise oil
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 lb Cake flour, sifted
           (about 8 cups)
 
   Preparation time: 40 minutes Standing time: 1 hour plus overnight
  Cooking time: 10 to 12 minutes Aging time: 1 week or more
  
   1. Mash baker's ammonia with a rolling pin if it is not powdered.
  Dissolve it in the milk in a small bowl and let stand 1 hour before
  using.
  
   2. Beat eggs in large bowl of electric mixer until thick and
  lemon-colored, about 5 minutes. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar
  until creamy and smooth. Add butter and beat again until creamy. Add
  anise oil, dissolved baker's ammonia and salt; beat to mix. Gradually
  beat in enough flour to make a stiff dough.
  
   3. Cut off pieces of dough and work in more flour on a floured work
  surface until dough is stiff enough to roll out and hold the design
  of the springerle rolling pin or mold. Roll out on a lightly floured
  board with a floured rolling pin to 1/4-inch thickness. Press design
  on dough with a floured springerle rolling pin or mold. Cut cookies
  apart using a floured knife. Leave on work surface covered with a
  clean kitchen towel overnight.
  
   4. The next day, heat oven to 325 degrees. Bake cookies on greased
  baking sheets, until barely golden on the bottom, 10 to 12 minutes.
   Cool on wire racks. Store in tightly covered tins and allow to
  mellow at least 1 week before serving.
  
   Note: This recipe also can be made using 1 1/2 teaspoons baking
  powder (in place of the milk and the baker's ammonia) and anise
  extract instead of anise oil. However, the cookies will not be as
  delicately textured and the anise flavor not quite as rich. If using
  baking powder, add it with the salt to the batter.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 tb Active dry yeast
  2 1/2 c  Water (110-degrees)
  7 1/2 c  Bread flour to 8 cups
      1 tb Salt
      1    Egg white (for glaze)
      1 tb Water (for glaze)
 
  In large bowl of electric mixer, dissolve yeast in
    2-1/2 c  water. Add 2-1/2 to 3 c flour; stir 1 minute. Batter will
  have consistency of soft pudding.
  
  Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place, free
  from drafts, overnight or at least 8 hours. The longer the sponge
  ferments, the better the flavor will be.
  
  The next day, stir in salt and 1 to 1-1/2 c  of remaining flour. Beat
  at medium speed with electric mixer 6 minutes, or beat 600 vigorous
  strokes by hand. Stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough.
  
  Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Clean and lightly flour
  bowl. Knead dough 15 to 20 minutes or until smooth, elastic, and no
  longer sticky.
  
  Place dough in floured bowl. Dust surface lightly with flour; cover
  with a slightly damp towel. Let rise in a warm place, free from
  drafts, until tripled in bulk, about 1-1/2 hours.
  
  Grease 2 large baking sheets or 4 French-bread pans.
  
  Punch down dough. Knead 2 minutes. Cover and let rest
       10    minutes.
  
  For oblong loaves, divide dough into 3 or 4 pieces, depending on
  desired thickness of loaves.
  
  On a lightly floured surface, shape each piece into a smooth log,
  gently tapering ends. For round loaves, divide dough in half. Shape
  each half into a smooth ball.
  
  Place shaped dough on prepared baking sheets. Cover with a dry towel.
  Let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
  
  Adjust oven racks to 2 lowest positions. Place a shallow roasting pan
  on lowest shelf; pour in 2 c boiling water.
  
  Preheat oven 15 minutes to 425-degrees.
  
  Slash tops of oblong loaves with 5 diagonal slashes each. Slash tops
  of each round loaf with 3 horizontal slashes and 3 vertical slashes
  in a tic-tac-toe design.
  
  Brush loaves with cold water.
  
  Bake 15 minutes.
  
  Brush loaves with egg-white glaze; bake 10 minutes longer.
  
  Brush again with egg-white glaze. Remove roasting pan from oven.
  
  Bake loaves 10 to 15 minutes longer, for a total of 35 to 40 minutes,
  or until bread sounds hollow when tapped on bottom.
  
  Remove from pans; place loaves directly on oven rack.
  
  Bake 5 minutes longer. Cool on racks. Makes 2 to 4 loaves.

      Title: 3 TOFU MARINADES~ PRESSING TOFU
 Categories: Vegetables, Sept.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           None
 
  Pressing: Split the block lengthwise.  lay several layers of paper
  towel on a flat surface; place the tofu cut side down on the towels,
  put another couple of layers of paper towel on top, cover with
  something flat and rigid (I use a cutting board) and place a weight
  on top (I use a gallon jug of brandy :-)
  
  I read somewhere that baking the tofu after pressing the water out and
  before marinating helps the tofu to absorb the marinade better. So, I
  cut up the tofu after pressing, then bake at 375 deg for 15 min. Then
  I put the tofu in the marinade, wait awhile, then stir fry or grill.
  Works great for me. From: pasquale@lanl.gov (Gina Pasquale).
  
  let it sit for 45 minutes or longer; this presses out the excess
  water in the tofu, and makes it chewier and less likely to crumble.
  It can then be grilled or baked, or cut up for use in stir-fries. I
  usually marinate it after pressing. Here are a couple of marinades to
  get you started:
  
  1) 1/2 cup light soy 1/2 cup dry sherry 2 tbs fresh grated ginger 2
  cloves minced garlic
  
  2) 1/2 cup fresh soy 1/2 cup lime juice 1 TBS ground cumin 1 TBS
  olive oil 2 serrano chiles, seeded and diced
  
  3) 1 cup orange juice 3 tbs jamaican jerk sauce

  ORIGINAL POSTERS NOTES: *NOTE: For greater flavor with little or no
  fat add, substitute no fat beef broth or some wine for part of the
  water called for in the ingredients.
  
  **If you have a sensitivity to sodium, note that the dry onion soup
  mix may be high in salt.  I have also posted a recipe for onion
  seasoning mix in CAT 3 TOPic 31 that was posted on the board sometime
  back that enables you to use your own mix and control the amount of
  salt in it.

 Categories: Chicken, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        2    Chicken breasts -- split
        4 TB Oil
        4 TB Butter
      1/4 c  Sweet vermouth
       40 c  Garlic; peeled -- whole
  
  Melt butter in frying pan.  Add oil.  Brown chicken well on both
  sides. Remove chicken.  Add garlic and saute for about a minute. Add
  dry vermouth. Stir. Put chicken back in the pan on top of garlic.
  Cover and simmer about one hour, turning chicken every once in a
  while. When done serve chicken with cloves of garlic. Garlic will pop
  out of the shell easily and you can either mash it onto some hot
  bread or eat it plain with the chicken. The garlic carmelizes when
  cooked with the vermouth and it is almost sweet-tasting. Good luck
  and I hope you enjoy this!!

      Title: 400-CLOVE GARLIC TURKEY FROM THE STINKING ROS
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1    Turkey
      4 oz Butter
      2 oz Olive oil
      1 c  Sage, fresh; chopped
      2 tb Garlic cloves, crushed
           Salt
           Pepper
      2 lb Garlic cloves; peeled
      2 c  Wine, white
      2 c  Stock, chicken
    1/2 c  Flour
 
  Turkey stock may be substituted for chicken stock, if available.
  
  Clean and wash the turkey and pat dry with a paper towel. Loosen the
  skin of the breast and rub the turkey under the skin with the sage
  and chopped garlic. Season the turkey inside and out with salt and
  pepper and remaining sage. Place turkey in a large roasting pan,
  preferably on a rack. Roast the turkey at 350 degrees, basting every
  twenty minutes with the melted butter and olive oil combined.
  
  An hour and half before the turkey will be finished, add the 400
  garlic cloves to the bottom of the roasting pan. Continue to baste
  the turkey and at the same time stir the cloves at the bottom of the
  pan. Then the turkey is done, remove it from the pan. Drain the
  drippings into a small sauce pan, reserving the garlic in the
  roasting pan. Place the roasting pan on a burner over medium-high
  heat. Add white wine and stock. Bring to a boil, stirring with a wisk
  to mash the roasted garlic cloves.
  
  Place the saucepan with the drippings over medium heat and with a
  whip add the flour to form a roux. Add the roux to the garlic gravy a
  little at a time until it reaches the desired thickness. Carve the
  turkey and serve with the 400-clove garlic gravy, accompnied by
  garlic mashed potatoes.
  
  This popular North Beach restaurant claims that it "seasons its
  garlic with food."  You'll see what they mean when you look at the
  list of ingredients.

      2 cn (4 oz. each) chopped green
           -chilies

           -Salsa
           -Shredded lettuce
           -Chopped tomatoes
           -Sliced ripe olives
 
  In a skillet, melt bacon grease over medium heat. Saute meat, onion,
  garlic tomatoes, chilies and potatoes until the onion softens. Add
  salt, oregano, chili powder and cilantro; simmer 2-3 minutes. Place a
  scant 1/2 cup meat filling on each tortilla. Fold, envelope-style,
  like a burrito. Fry seam side down, in 1/2 inch of hot oil (360-375
  degrees) until crispy and brown. Turn and brown other side. Drain
  briefly on a paper towel. Place on a serving plate and top with
  shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream, guacamole and salsa. Place
  shredded lettuce next to chimichanga and top with tomatoes and
  olives. Serve immediately. Yield: 12 servings. Though still debated.
  Tuscon is generally credited as the original home of the chimichanga
  (a fried "burro", as we call them, stuffed with meat, onions and
  chilies).  I've combined several recipes into this one, and it's
  fairly authentic.

 Categories: Dips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lg Refried beans
      2 cn Jalapenos; or chilies
      2    Tomatoes; or more
      1    Onion; (optional)
     16 oz Sour cream
      2    Avacados
      2 pk Taco seasoning
           Shredded cheese; (mozzarlla
      1    Olives
 
  Recipe by: Rachel Hosford Spence --ALASKA <JSRKH@ACAD1.ALASKA.EDU>
  Mix the refried beans and taco seasoning together (I also mix the
  chili's in with this, but some people put the chilis as a layer) Mix
  this really well (I used a food processor, but today I am going to
  use my mixer). This is the first layer.
  
  Put a layer of sour cream on top of the refried beans, taco seasoning
  and chilis.
  
  Next put a layer of well mixed/mushed avacados (you need enough to
  cover the pan, I use a cake pan normally) on top of everything else
  
  Next sprinkle cheeses on top (I just thought about it and I put the
  avacado first and then the sour cream, but I suppose it doesnt
  matter). I think the more cheese the better myself *grin*!
  
  Next cut up tomatoes and add as many as you like, which I like to use
  at least 2 cut up tomatoes.
  
  Last put chopped up olives.
  
  Put in the oven until the cheese is melted. I use a low heat so that
  everyt else warms up.
  
  Last but not least pull out the chips and dip! Everyone really enjoys
  this dip. I hope you do too.

    2/3 tb Blackstrap molasses
  1 3/4 tb Malt syrup
      1 tb Yeast
  1 1/8 c  9 grain mix
  5 1/2 c  Hard whole wheat flour
      1 ts Salt
  3 1/2 tb Oil
 
  From the Arcata Co-op Bakery
  
  THis bread will not only nourish you, it will surprise you with its
  unique and delightful flavor and texture. Definetly worth the extra
  effort of finding the 9-grain mix ingredients. The mix will keep well
  in the refrigerator - we're sure you'll want to make this bread again
  (try a handful in pancakes!).
  
  Mix the water, molasses, malt and yeast.  Add the 9 grain mix, flour,
  salt and oil (you can also make a sponge and wait, but it's not
  necessary). Mix, and knead dough well. Let rise, shape into loaves
  and let rise again in oiled bread pans.  Bake at 350 F for 45 min.

      Title: 93079 FLOUR TORTILLAS
 Categories: Mexican, Breads
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      3 c  Unsifted flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/4 c  Shortening or lard
      1 c  Lukewarm water
           Shortening or lard
 
  Put flour and baking powder in bowl and mix.  Cut shortening into
  flour with pastry blender until size of peas.  Add water gradually.
  Stir until dough is stiff.  Form into a ball and knead thoroughly
  until smooth on a lightly floured board.  At this point you can
  grease the surface of the dough, cover tightly and refrigerate for as
  long as 24 hours before using; if you do this, the dough will be
  easier to handle. Let dough return to room temperature before you
  begin to roll it out (about 1 hour). Divide dough into 8 balls for
  large, thin tortillas or 11 balls for regular-sized, 7 inch
  tortillas. For large, thin tortillas, roll as thin as possible on a
  lightly floured board.  Drop onto a very hot ungreased skillet. Bake
  until freckled on one side.  (This should take only about 20
  seconds.) Lift edge with spatula, turn, and bake on second side. To
  serve at once, fold hot, limp tortilla around pieces of butter. Or
  cool tortillas, wrap airtight, and refrigerate or freeze.  To serve
  later, reheat or fry by methods described below.  Makes one dozen
  tortillas (1/16 inch thick). To reheat and soften corn or flour
  tortillas on an ungreased surface: Fresh tortillas are already soft
  in a sense, but when heated they become even more tender and
  flexible. If tortillas are dry and a little hard, dip your hand in
  water and rub it lightly onto surfaces of the bread before heating.
  Be sure not to heat them longer than necessary to soften and warm
  thoroughly, or they will become hard and brittle. Place tortillas so
  they do not overlap on a medium-hot griddle or in a heavy frying pan
  over medium-high heat. Turn frequently until soft and hot, about 30
  seconds. Put immediately into a tightly covered dish, or put into a
  foil packet and seal it, and hold in a 200 degree oven until all
  tortillas are heated. (The secret is to keep them from drying out
  once heated.) To soften corn or flour tortillas by frying:  Heat
  about 1/4 inch of salad oil, shortening, or lard in a frying pan over
  medium-high heat. Quickly turn one or two tortillas at a time in oil;
  they soften almost immediately. Do not allow them to become crisp.
  Drain on paper towels.  To crisp-fry whole corn or flour tortillas:
  Heat 1 inch of salad oil, shortening, or lard in a frying pan to
  350-375 degrees. Fry 1 tortilla at a time, using a spatula to turn
  frequently or to hold it under the fat until it crisps, puffs
  slightly, and browns lightly (about 1 minute or less).  Drain on
  paper towels.

      Title: A BAG OF BEAN TRICKS
 Categories: Beans, Soups, Text
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  A bag of bean tricks to help you buy, soak, cook & store dry beans.
  
  Canned beans do not require additional cooking since they have been
  thoroughly cooked in the canning process, but there are several ways
  of preparing dry beans for cooking. All start with a thorough
  inspection for damaged beans and foreign material, then washing in
  cold water. The next step, which is highly recommended, is soaking
  the beans. This not only helps make the beans cook faster, it also
  improves flavor, texture, appearance and digestibility. For maximum
  improvement of these factors, it is recommended that the soak water
  be discarded and the beans rinsed and cooked in fresh water.
  
  SOAKING TIPS: Hot-soak (preferred) and Quick-soak method.
  
  For every pound of dry beans, any variety, add 10 cups of hot water.
  Remember beans will rehydrated to at least twice theri dry size, so
  be sure to start with a large enough pot. (Note: up to 2 teaspoons of
  salt per pound of beans *may* be added to help the beans absorb water
  more evenly.) Heat to boiling, let boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove
  from heat, cover and set aside for at least 1 hour (quick-soak
  method), but *preferably* four hours or more.  The longer soaking
  time is recommended to allow a greater amount of the gas-causing
  properties to dissolve in the water, thus helping the beans to be
  more easily digested and lessening the aftereffects. Whether you soak
  the beans for an hour or several hours, remember to DISCARD THE SOAK
  WATER.
  
  COOKING TIPS: (for each pound of dry beans)
  
  Standard method:  Drain and rinse soaked beans; put into a good- sized
  kettle.  Add 6 cup of hot water, 1 to 2 Tablespoons shortening and 2
  teaspoons salt. Boil gently with lid tilted until desired tenderness
  is reached.
  
  Savory Method:  Use standard method (above), but use 2 teaspoons
  onion salt and 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt instead of plain salt. Add 1
  Tablespoon chicken stock base or 3 to 4 bouillon cubes and 1/4
  teaspoon white pepper.
  
  * Simmer beans slowly.  Cooking too fast can break skins.
  
  * Acid slows down cooking.  Add tomatoes, vinegar, etc. last.
  
  * Add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (no more) per pound of beans
  when cooking in hard water to shorten cooking time.
  
  * At high altitudes, beans take longer to cook.  A pressure cooker
  helps, but follow manufacturer's directions. [Personal note: Tom says
  1/2 hour in the pressure cooker at 15 lbs pressure is equivalent to
  cooking them overnight.  Don't put too many beans in the pressure
  cooker, as they expand:  you don't want to plug up the vent hole.)
  
  * Refried beans are made from freshly cooked pinto, pink, red or
  kidney beans, mashed and cooked in a skillet with bacon drippings,
  lard, oil, butter or margarine.

      Title: A BETTER POT ROAST
 Categories: Meats, Mine
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    First-cut brisket (5 lb)
           -trimmed of all visible fat
           Freshly ground black pepper
    1/4 c  Corn oil
      8    Onion(s), thickly sliced
           -separated into rings
      6    Carrots, peeled
           -cut in chunks
      3    Garlic clove(s), minced
      2    Bay leaves
      4 tb Tomato paste
           Salt to taste
     16 oz Can tomatoes, with juice
      1 c  Dry red wine
 
  Note: Make this a day ahead so you can skim off the fat. Preheat oven
  to 375øF. Cover both sides of brisket with lots of pepper. Over a
  medium flame, heat the oil in a heavy casserole or roasting dish and
  brown the brisket on all sides. Take the brisket out of the pan and
  set aside. Add the onions to the casserole and cook them over
  medium-high heat. As you stir them, scrape up the brown bits from the
  bottom of the casserole. cook the onions for about 15 minutes, or
  until they are thoroughly browned. Add the carrots, garlic, and bay
  leaves; stir for another 1-2 minutes. Take the casserole off the
  burner and carefully put the brisket back into its nest of
  vegetables. Coat the brisket on both sides with tomato paste.
  Sprinkle more pepper, and a little salt, over the tomato paste. Pour
  the tomatoes and red wine into the bottom of the casserole. Cover the
  casserole tightly, first with a layer of foil and then with the lid.
  Let the pot roast cook on the middle rack of the oven for 3« hours.
  check the liquid level in the casserole frequently; if it gets too
  low, add a little water or beef broth. When the meat is tender, take
  it out of the oven. Keep the meat covered while you cool it to room
  temperature. Then put it in the refrigerator overnight. The next day,
  spoon off all the solidified fat you can. Discard the bay leaves.
  Bring the meat back to room temperature and reheat it ÄÄ along with
  its juices and the vegetables ÄÄ either on top of the stove or in the
  oven. When it's hot, slice it on the diagonal and serve with the pan
  juices and vegetables spooned over. Add salt at the table, if needed.

      Title: A BLOOMIN' ONION
 Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Water; ice
           Water; boiling
      4    Eggs; beaten
      2 tb Flour
      1 c  Cracker crumbs
 
  Select a well-rounded onion. Peel outer skin off. Leave root intact
  and cut off any hanging roots. Using a small, sharp knife, divide
  onion into four sections by making 2 cuts crosswise, beginning at the
  top and cutting toward root, stopping about 1/2" away. Cut each
  section twice. Place onion in bowl of enough boiling water to cover
  it and leave for 5 minutes. The sections, or petals, will begin to
  open. Remove onion from water and immerse into ice water, which will
  further the opening. Drain well by turning upside down on paper
  towel. Put flour into paper bag, add onion and shake gently to coat
  with flour. Roll floured onion in beaten egg to cover. Put cracker
  crumbs or coating in bag, add onion, and shake gently to coat.
  Refrigerate 1 hour before deep frying in oil to golden brown, 3 to 5
  minutes. Cooked onion can be kept for a time in warm oven. This
  recipe was posted some weeks ago. It did not include a sauce. If I
  remember correctly, the poster said to serve with Ranch Dressing for
  a sauce. I would just let my imagination go, on the sauce! I haven't
  tried this yet, even though it is tempting...I have to watch out for
  my husband's diet, so we try to stay away from fried things. Sorry, I
  don't know the name of the original poster, but that is his/her ID,
  after the recipe title. Barb Day

      Title: A BUCHE DE NOEL   --   FRENCH YULE LOG CAKE
 Categories: Xmas, Holidays, Cakes, French
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
           This file contains the
           .  directions only.  For
           .  the ingredients and a
           .  list of special equipment
           .  needed, please see
           .  Part #1.
 
  **  THE ORANGE/ALMOND SPONGE SHEET  ** Preparing the pan. Preheat the
  oven to 375 degrees. Line the jelly-roll pan with buttered wax paper,
  leaving a 2-inch overhang at each end. Roll flour in the pan and
  shake out excess.
  
  The cake batter. Using a wire whisk or hand-held electric mixer, beat
  the 3 egg yolks in a 3-quart bowl, gradually sprinkling in the 1/2
  cup of sugar. When the mixture is thick and pale yellow, beat in the
  grated orange rind and juice, the almonds, and the almond extract.
  Slowly sift in the flour, while blending with the whisk. In a very
  clean separate bowl with clean beaters, beat the egg whites to soft
  peaks; sprinkle in the 3 tbsp of sugar and continue beating to form
  stiff, shining peaks. Stir a quarter of the egg whites into the
  batter; delicately fold in the rest.
  
  Baking the jelly roll. Immediately turn the batter into the prepared
  pan; bang it lightly but firmly on your work surface to settle it,
  and place it at once in the middle level of the preheated 375 degree
  oven. Bake about 10 minutes, until it has very lightly colored and
  the top is springy-do not overbake or the cake will crack when you
  roll it up.
  
  Cooling and storing. Sprinkle the top of the cake with a 1/16 inch
  layer of confectioner's sugar; cover with a sheet of wax paper and a
  lightly dampened towel. Reverse onto a tray or baking sheet. Then
  whlle the cake is still warm, holding an end of the wax paper, lift
  off the jelly-roll pan. Carefully peel the wax paper off the cake.
  Sift another 1/16-inch layer of sugar over the cake and roll it up in
  the damp towel; place in a plashc bag to keep it from drying out, and
  refrigerate. (The cake must be cold before you fill and frost it.)
  
  ** Ahead-of-time note: The sponge sheet will keep nicely 2 or 3 days
  in the refrigerator or you may freeze it for several weeks -- but to
  prevent its breaking, be sure to let it defrost completely before
  unrolling it.
  
  **  THE MERINGUE BASE-ITALIAN MERINGUE  **
  
  Beat the egg whites in the electric mixer until foaming through out;
  add the salt and cream of tartar and continue beating until soft
  peaks are formed. Turn mixer speed to slow. In a small saucepan bring
  the sugar and 1/2 cup water to the simmer, remove from heat, and
  swirl the pan until the sugar has dissolved completely and the liquid
  is perfectly clear. Cover the pan tightly and boil to the soft-ball
  stage (238 degrees). Using moderately slow speed, gradually whip the
  hot syrup into the egg whites; increase speed to fast and continue at
  high speed for 5 rninutes, until egg whites form stiff shining peaks
  and have completely cooled. Plan to use the meringue promptly.
  
  **  MERINGUE MUSHROOMS  **
  
  Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Scoop a quarter of the me ringue
  into the pastry bag and squeeze out 8 to 10 half-inch domes on the
  pastry sheet, to serve as mushroom caps. Hold the l/8-inch tube over
  the end of the pastry bag and squeeze out 8 to 10 conical shapes 3/4
  inch high, for the stems. Bake about 1 hour in the middle level of
  the oven, until the meringues push easily off the pastry sheet-they
  should color no more than a darkish cream. Return unused meringue to
  the main mixture. ** Ahead-of-time note: Meringues may be made in
  advance and frozen.
  
  **  The Directions will continue in Part #3  **

      Title: A BUCHE DE NOEL   --   FRENCH YULE LOG CAKE
 Categories: Xmas, Holidays, Cakes, French
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
           This file completes the
           .  directions.
 
  **  THE FILLING AND FROSTING  **
  
  Beat the smoothly melted chocolate into the meringue, along with the
  vanilla, rum, and soft butter. Remove two-thirds of the mixture to a
  bowl and refrigerate; this is the frosting. Beat the additional half
  stick of soft butter into the remaining meringue this is the filling.
  
  **  FILLING THE CAKE  **
  
  Unroll the sponge sheet and slice a quarter inch off the long sides
  so that the cake will roll easily. Spread the filling over the top of
  the sheet. Roll it up from one of the small ends and you have made
  the log shape. Neatly slice a narrow slanting piece from each end of
  the log. With a small knife dig a hole in an upper side of the log
  and insert a piece of the scrap to simulate a bump or a branch. Place
  the log seam-side down on the serving board and slip double sheets of
  wax paper under the edge of each side and the two ends-to catch
  frosting spills.
  
  **  FROSTING THE LOG  **
  
  Beat 2 or more spoonfuls of sifted cocoa into the frosting mixture to
  make it a spreadable consistency. (Reserve 2 spoonfuls of frosting
  for the mushrooms.) Leaving the two ends free, frost the cake using a
  flexible metal spatula, then scumble it with the spatula and a fork
  to give it a rough barklike look.
  
  ** Ahead-of-time note: Refrigerate the log if you are not contin-
  uing; it will keep nicely for a day-if you can find a non-mashing
  cover for it.
  
  **  FINAL DECORATIONS, JUST BEFORE SERVING  **
  
  The mushrooms. With a small knife, pierce a hole in the bottom of each
  meringue mushroom cap, insert a bit of the frosting (or softened
  butter) into the hole and then the pointed end of a meringue stem.
  Arrange the mushrooms in tasteful clusters upon the log and sprinkle
  the log with a dusting of confectioner's sugar to give a snowy
  effect. Dust the tops of the mushrooms with cocoa powder tapped from
  the sieve.
  
  The caramel veil. Bring the sugar to the simmer with the corn syrup
  and one-third cup water in a small saucepan; when the mixture is
  completely dissolved and clear, cover tightly and boil to the caramel
  stage. Let it cool two to three minutes, until it forms thick strands
  when lifted with a fork. Then dip the fork into the syrup and wave it
  over the broomstick, to form long hanging threads of caramel.
  
  The finale. Lift the caramel strands off the broomstick; drape them
  over the yule log. Decorate the serving board with sprigs of holly if
  you wish, and the buche de Noel is ready to serve.

      Title: A GRETE PYE
 Categories: Medieval, Main dish, Meat
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Shortcrust pastry
      1    Egg white, beaten
           Until liquid
      1 lb Boned breasts of chicken
           Pigeon or wild duck and/or
           Saddle of hare or rabbit
           (not stewing meat)
           Salt and black pepper
      1 lb Minced beef
      2 tb Shredded suet
      3    Hard-boiled egg
           Yolks crumbled
    1/4 ts Each ground
           Cinnamon and mace
           And a pinch of ground cloves
      1 oz Stoned cooking dates chopped
      1 oz Currants
      2 oz Stoned prunes soaked
           And drained
    1/2 c  Beef stock
      1 tb Rice flour or cornflour
 
  No Christmas feast in medieval times was complete without a 'grete
  pye'. In some recipes, it could contain many varied meats, but quite
  often only two or three different kinds were suggested; change the
  meats suggested here if you wish. Use just over half the pastry to
  line a 23-cm/9-inch pie plate. Brush the inside with some of the egg
  white. Skin the pieces of breast and other meat if necessary and
  parboil them gently in salted water for 10-15 minutes.  Drain and
  leave to cool. Mix together in a bowl the minced beef, suet, salt and
  pepper to taste, the egg yolks and half the spice mixture. Add the
  rest of the spices to the dried fruit in another bowl. Slice the
  parboiled meat. Pre-heat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas Mark 7. Add 1 or 2
  tablespoons of the beef stock to the rice flour or cornflour in a
  small saucepan and cream them together; then add the remaining stock
  and stir over gentle heat until slightly thickened. Keep aside. Cover
  the bottom of the pastry case with half the mince mixture. Arrange
  the sliced meat in a flat layer on top. Scatter the chopped spiced
  fruit over it and cover with the remaining mince.  Pour the thickened
  stock over the lot. Roll out the remaining pastry into a round to
  make a lid for the pie. Brush the rim of the case with a little more
  egg white and cover with the lid. Press the edges to seal, and make
  escape slits for steam. Decorate with the pastry trimmings and glaze
  with egg white. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to
  160C/325F/Gas Mark 3 and bake for 45-50 minutes longer. Serves 6 to
  8. Grete pyes. Take faire yonge beef, And suet of a fatte beste, or
  of Motton, and hak all this on a borde small; and caste therto pouder

      Title: A JELLIE OF FYSHE
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8 oz Cod
      3    Scallops
      3 oz Shrimp
      2    Onions sliced
      1 tb White wine vinegar
      1 oz Ginger root, peeled,
           Finely chopped
    1/3 ts Sea salt
    1/4 ts White pepper
      2 c  White wine
      2 c  Water
    3/4 oz Gelatin
 
  Put the codfish (or other white fish) in a pan with the onions,
  vinegar, ginger root, spices, wine and water. Bring it gently to the
  boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the scallops and prawns and cook
  for a further 3 minutes. Remove the fish; bone and skin the white
  fish and set it all aside. Strain the cooking juices and set aside to
  cool for several hours by which time a lot of the sediment will have
  settled in the bottom of the bowl. Carefully pour off the juices,
  leaving the sediment, and then strain several times through a clean
  teacloth. You should have appoximately 3 cups of liquid left. Melt
  3/4 oz of gelatin in a little of the liquid, cool it to room
  temperature, then mix it into the rest of the juices. Pour a thin
  layer (1/2 inch) of the juice into the bottom of a 5 cup souffle dish
  or fish mold and put it in the fridge to set. Flake the white fish
  into smallish flakes; remove the coral from the scallops and cut the
  white flesh into three of four pices. Once the jelly is firm, arrange
  the most decorative of the fish in the bottom of the dish-- some
  scallop coral in the middle, prawns around the outsides, flakes of
  white fish in between or however you feel inspired. Spoon a little
  more of the juice and return it to the fridge to set. Continue to
  layer the fish in the mould, setting each layer with a covering of
  juice until you have used up all the fish and juices. Leave the jelly
  to set for at least 4 hours in a fridge. Unmold and decorate with
  fresh herbs; serve as a starter.

      1 sm Bn flat-leaf parsley
      1 ea Bay leaf
           Fresh rosemary and thyme
           Black peppercorns
 
  Put 3 quarts of water in the bottom of a large stock pot with a pasta
  insert. Add the tomato liquid and tomato paste. Put all of the other
  ingredients in the pasta insert. Bring to a boil over high heat,
  lower the heat, cover and simmer for about 3 hours. Lift out the
  pasta insert, letting out the liquid fall back into the pot. Press
  down on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible and return
  all the liquid to the pot. Discard the solids.
  
  Note: This started out to be vegetable stock to use up some leftover
  stuff I had on hand, but after I strained the stock I decided to use
  it as a cooking liquid for pasta. The pasta thickened and flavored
  the stock to such an extent that I decided to save the leftovers to
  use as a tomato-vegetable soup. I may add some vegetables and small
  pasta to that.

      1 c  SUGAR.

      1    EGG.
      1 c  BUTTERMILK.
      1 ts SODA.
      3 c  FLOUR.
  2 1/2 ts BAKING POWDER.
      1 ts SALT.
 
  Try mixing Vanilla and egg  beat until mixed. Add the Buttermilk and
  the Soda; (I have used 7up) and sift the dry ingredients into this.
  add the rest of the ingredients, mix well. Put the container into the
  refrigerator chill over night. Take out and roll small pieces of the
  dough into long strips, then form them into a figure eight,(like a
  pretzel) put them back into the Refrigerator for about an hour, when
  they have raised to approximately what looks to be the right hight.
  Bake in a 450 deg pre-heated oven for approximately 6 to 8 minutes, (
  May vary with the weather so keep an eye on them).But they should be
  a light brown before you remove them. Refrigeration is one of the
  keys of "KRINGLA" making. They must be refrigerated in order for them
  to get the flavor, you could bake them without refrigeration but you
  lose a lot of the flavor. You can also use. A:  OATMEAL. B: RAISINS.
  C: WHOLE WHEAT. You can fill them with your favorite filling, Cream
  Cheese, Jelly, ETC. you don't need eggs or yeast. They are not too
  sweet, and definitely not Boring like a bagel, (Sorry Bagel lovers,
  VBG). It is a coffee Bread not like Muffins, which are too sweet, and
  also do not have too many calories. This recipe came from a fella
  from the town of LOS OSOS CA He is a out of work Carpenter who
  started baking and selling these wonderful Rolls, He said that this
  is an original recipe that he got from his grandmother, (Yea for the
  Grandmas). Ive tried Nuts, and love the cream Cheese one, You could
  even use Custard Filling, Ive also used Different flavored oils like
  Pure orange oil, Butterscotch, several Berries types. and they turned

      Title: A SHORTCUT TO SOAP MAKING
 Categories: Info
      Yield: 1 Info
 
      1    Information
 
  If you do not wish to handle lye, do not have wood ashes available,
  or do not have the time to make soap from scratch, you can still make
  homemade soaps.  You can purchase castille granules at most
  drugstores. There is no need to mess with lye when using these
  granules. Since they are actually granulated soap, it is easy to make
  soap from them.
  
  Put the granules into a kettle and add water. Instructions for use
  will probably be on the package. If not, use common sense in adding
  water. (Don't drown the granules.) Heat the mixture at low to medium
  heat and stir it constantly with a large wooden spoon. The granules
  will dissolve. Stir the mixture until it is smooth. Remove it from
  the heat and add any other ingredients or emolients that you want.
  Stir them in well as the soap cools.  Add perfume (if desired) as
  they very last ingredient. Blend it in so that the fragrance will be
  evenly dispersed. Pour the mixture into molds, and let harden. If the
  soap does not set (that is, if the bars do not get hard) reheat the
  mixture, adding more castille granules as necessary. Before it cools
  completely, you will need to add more perfume because reheating the
  mix will release the volatile floral oils, thus destroying them.

MMMMM----------------------SQUID DISH--1475---------------------------
 
   Platina mentions several odd fishes not usually used today as food,
  such as cuttlefish, scorpions, lampreys and sea-lion. But most of his
  fish are still favorites-eels, lobsters, crabs, oysters, sturgeon and
  sturgeon eggs (which he calls caviar),  salmon, sole, etc., and he
  gives a recipe for a Squid Dish for Days of Abstinence. Although
  squid is eaten today in the South of France and Greece, and can be
  found in special fish shops here, I would prefer salmon or halibut.
  But if you hanker for squid, just go ahead with it if you can find
  some, and be sure to have the fish man prepare it for you by removing
  the black liquid from the backbone. A SQUID DISH FOR DAYS OF
  ABSTINENCE--1475 Boil the squid. Crush what is good in a mortar.

  or, if you can't provide this, use the juice of peas or white
  chickpeas. Crush together small grapes and five figs. Mix a little
  rock parsley and a little fresh marjoram leaves. Add as much
  cinnamon, ginger and sugar as is necessary. Mix these well with
  whites of eggs so that they will stick together and cook better. With

      Title: A TO Z OF SPICES (PART 1)
 Categories: Info/tips, Spices
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           No Ingredients
 
  ALLSPICE: These small dark, reddish-brown berries are so called
  because their aroma and flavor resemble a combination of cinnamon,
  cloves and nutmeg. Use berries whole in marinades; for boiling and
  pot roasting meats and poultry; in fish dishes, pickles and chutneys.
  Also available ground and excellent for flavoring soups, sauces and
  desserts.
  
  ANISE: Commonly called asniseed, these small, brown oval seeds have
  the sweet, pungent flavor of licorice. Also available ground. Use
  seeds in stews and vegetable dishes, or sprinkle over loaves and
  rolls before baking. Try ground anise for flavoring fish dishes and
  pastries for fruit pies.
  
  CARAWAY: Small brown, crescent-shaped seeds with a strong liquorice
  flavor and especially delicious as a flavoring in braised cabbage and
  sauerkraut recipes, breads (particularly rye), cakes and cheeses.
  
  CARDAMOM: Small, triangular-shaped pods containing numerous small
  black seeds which have a warm, highly aeromatic flavor. You can buy
  green or black cardamoms although the smaller green type is more
  widely available.
  
  CAYENNE: Orangey-red in color, this ground pepper is extremely hot and
  pungent. Not to be confused with paprika which, although related, is
  mild flavored.
  
  CHILI POWDER: Made from dried red chilies. This red powder varies in
  flavor and hotness, from mild to hot. A less fiery type is found in
  chili seasoning.
  
  CINNAMON & CASSIA: Shavings of bark from the cinnamon tree are
  processed and curled to form cinnamon sticks. Also available in
  ground form. Spicy, fragrant and sweet, it is used widely in savory
  and sweet dishes. Cassia (from the dried bark of the cassia tree) is
  similar to cinnamon, but less delicate in flavor with a slight
  pungent 'bite'.
  
  CLOVES: These dried, unopened flower buds give a warm aroma and
  pungency to foods, but should be used with care as the flavor can
  become overpowering. Available in ground form. Cloves are added to
  soups, sauces, mulled drinks, stewed fruits and apple pies.
  
  CORIANDER: Available in seed and ground form. These tiny, pale brown
  seeds have a mild, spicy flavor with a slight orange peel fragrance.
  An essential spice in curry dishes, but also extremely good in many
  cake and cookie recipes.
  
  CUMIN: Sold in seed or ground. Cumin has a warm, pungent aromatic
  flavor and is used extensively in flavor curries and many Middle
  Eastern and Mexican dishes. Popular in Germany for flavoring
  sauerkraut and pork dishes. Use ground or whole in meat dishes and
  stuffed vegetables.
  
  All spices should be stored in small airtight jars in a cool, dark
  place, as heat, moisture and sunlight reduce their flavor.

      Title: A TO Z OF SPICES (PART 2)
 Categories: Info/tips, Spices
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           No Ingredients
 
  FENUGREEK: These small, yellow-brown seeds have a slight bitter flavor
  which, when added in small quantities, is very good in curries,
  chutneys and pickles, soups, fish and shellfish dishes.
  
  GINGER: Available in many forms. Invaluable for adding to many savory
  and sweet dishes and for baking gingerbread and brandy snaps. Fresh
  ginger root looks like a knobby stem. It should be peeled and finely
  chopped or sliced before use. Dreid ginger root is very hard and
  light beige in color. To release flavor, "bruise" with a spoon or
  soak in hot water before using. This dried type is more often used in
  pickling, jam making and preserving. Also available in ground form,
  preserved stem ginger and crystallized ginger.
  
  MACE & NUTMEG: Both are found on the same plant. The nutmeg is the
  inner kernel of the fruit. When ripe, the fruit splits open to reveal
  bright red arils which lie around the shell of the nutmeg - and once
  dried are known as mace blades. The flavor of both spices is very
  similar - warm, sweet and aromatic, although nutmeg is more delicate
  than mace. Both spices are also sold ground. Use with vegetables;
  sprinkled over egg dishes, milk puddings and custards; eggnogs and
  mulled drinks; or use as a flavoring in desserts.
  
  PAPRIKA: Comes from a variety of pepper (capsicum) and although
  similar in color to cayenne, this bright red powder has a mild flavor.
  
  PEPPER: White pepper comes from ripened berries with the outer husks
  removed. Black pepper comes from unripened berries dried until dark
  greenish-black in color. Black pepper is more subtle than white. Use
  white or black peppercorns in marinades and pickling, or freshly
  ground as a seasoning. Both are available ground. Green peppercorns
  are also unripe berries with a mild, light flavor. They are canned in
  brine or pickled, or freeze-dried in jars. They add a pleasant, light
  peppery flavor to sauces, pates and salad dressings. Drain those
  packed in liquid and use either whole or mash them lightly before
  using. Dry green peppercorns should be lightly crushed before using
  to help release flavor, unless otherwise stated in a recipe.
  
  POPPY SEEDS: These tiny, slate-blue seeds add a nutty flavor to both
  sweet and savory dishes. Sprinkle over desserts and breads.
  
  SAFFRON: This pice comes from the stigmas of a species of crocus. It
  has a distinctive flavor and gives a rich yellow coloring to dishes,
  however, it is also the most expensive spice to buy. Available in
  small packets or jars (either powdered or in strands - the strands
  being far superior in flavor). This spice is a must for an authentic
  paella or Cornish Saffron Cake. Also an extremely good flavoring for
  soups, fish and chicken dishes.
  
  SESAME SEEDS: High in protein and mineral oil content, sesame seeds
  have a crisp texture and sweet, nutty flavor which combines well in
  curries and with chicken, pork and fish dishes. Use also to sprinkle
  over breads, cookies and pastries before baking.
  
  STAR ANISE: This dried, star-shaped seed head has a pungent, aromatic
  smell, rather similar to fennel. Use very sparingly in stir-fry
  dishes. Also good with fish and poultry.
  
  TURMERIC: Closely related to ginger, it is an aromatic root which is
  dried and ground to produce a bright, orange-yellow powder. It has a
  rich, warm, distinctive smell, a delicate, aromatic flavor and helps
  give dishes an attractive yellow coloring. Use in curries, fish and
  shellfish dishes, rice pilafs and lentil mixtures. It is also a
  necessary ingredient in mustard pickles and piccalilli.
  
  All spices should be stored in small airtight jars in a cool, dark
  place, as heat, moisture and sunlight reduce their flavor.

      Title: A&W ROOT BEER
 Categories: Top secret, More
      Yield: 5 Cups
 
    3/4 c  Granulated Sugar
    3/4 c  Hot Water
      1 l  Cold Seltzer Water
    1/2 ts Plus 1/8 t root beer-
           Concentrate (McCormick is-
           Best)
 
  1.  Dissolve the sugar in the hot water. 2. Add the root beer
  concentrate and let cool. 3. Combine the root beer mixture with the
  cold seltzer water, drink immediately, or store in fridge in tightly
  covered container.
  
  The root beer you'll make here is a simplified version of Roy Allen's
  method from the early 1900's.  Instead of harvesting roots, herbs, and
  berries, you have the luxury of using a root beer concentrate that
  can be found in most grocery stores. In 1922 Allen expanded his
  business, he formed a partnership with entrepreneur Frank Wright.
  This led to the name that would become famous, A&W, the country's
  best-selling root beer.

      1 c  White cornmeal
      1 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/2 c  All-bran cereal
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ginger
    3/4 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped
    1/2 c  Dates, chopped
    2/3 c  Powdered skim milk
  1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
    1/2 c  Honey
    1/2    Orange; unpeeled
      1 c  Rhubarb; chopped
           Margarine; to grease cans
      2    37 oz empty cans
 
   Mix together in a bowl all the dry ingredients including dates and
  walnuts (leave out only the buttermilk, honey, orange half and
  rhubarb). Put the buttermilk and the honey in the blender. Wash an
  orange, cut off any price or brand marks and cut it in half. Cut the
  orange half into chunks and add it to the blender, being sure that
  you have removed all the seeds. Run the blender until the orange
  chunks are chopped into little bits. Now add the buttermilk mixture,
  along with the rhubarb chunks, to the dry ingredients and mix well.
   Pour immediately into greased cans, filling each can no more than
  two-thirds full. Cover the filled cans with aluminum foil, and secure
  the foil with a rubber bands. Place them in a large pot, on some kind
  of a rack so they are not touching the bottom of the pot. Pour in hot
  water until the bottom 2 inches of the cans are covered. Bring to a
  boil and keep the water boiling gently for about 1 1/2 hours.
   The pot should be covered and there should be a little steam
  escaping at all times. Check the pot occasionally to make sure that
  there is enough water left.
   At the end of 1 1/2 hours, check with a skewer, right through the
  foil. If it does not come out clean, cook for another half hour and
  recheck. When the loaves are done, take the "hot" cans out of the
  pot. When you are ready to serve, uncover a mold, shake the loaf out
  onto a breadboard and slice it. Serve warm with butter or cream
  cheese.

      Yield: 1 Cake
 
      5 ea Egg; separated
    275 g  Sugar, granu;ated
      1 ea Lemon; juiced
      2 ea Lemons; zest, grated
    250 g  Almonds; ground
    300 g  Carrots; finely grated
     75 g  Cornflour
      1 pn Cinnamon, ground
      1 pn Cloves, ground
     10 g  Baking powder
     50 ml Kirsch
      1 pn Salt

MMMMM--------------------------GLAZING-------------------------------
     50 g  Apricot jelly
           Fondant icing
           Marzipan carrots
 
    The Story: The cultivation of vegetables in Aargau is one of the
  main reasons for the existence of a thriving canning/bottling
  industry. In this area, the carrot is the Queen of all vegetables and
  it has attributes which allow it to be used everywhere, even in
  desserts.
    This carrot cake is now a Swiss classic, its reputation having been
  extended long ago far beyond the borders of the canton. Some maintain
  that the cake is better two days after baking as the carrots keep it
  moist.
    The Recipe: Beat together the egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice and
  lemon zest, until light. Add the finely grated carrots and the
  almonds.
    Mix in the cornflour, cinnamon, ground cloves and baking powder.
  Then add the kirsch. Mix or beat until smooth. Beat the egg whites
  until stiff and carefully fold in.
    Butter a tin (24 cm diameter, 5 cm high), dust with flour. Turn the
  mixture into the tin. Bake in the oven for 50 ... 60 minutes at 180
  oC. When cooked, brush the cake with a hot apricot glaze and thin
  fondant icing. Decorate with small marzipan carrots.

  1 1/3 c  Flour
    2/3 c  Cornmeal
    1/2 c  Sugar
      3 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
        pn Salt
      1 c  Sour cream

      5 tb Butter; melted
     12 oz Can Green Gian Mexicorn;optl
    1/2 c  Bacon; coarsely chopped
           Cupcake papers
 
  I like to add the Mexicorn and bacon to this recipe. It certainly does
  enhance the flavor, but if you want plain corn muffins, you can
  certainly omit these 2 ingredients. Preheat oven to 400~. You'll need
  either one or two 12 unit muffin tins, lined with cupcake papers.
  Whisk the dry ingredients together, throughly, in a bowl and set
  aside. Whisk the sour cream, eggs amd melted butter together until
  well-blended. Make a well in the dry ingredients, pour in
  cream/butter/egg mixture and if you're adding the corn and bacon, add
  them now. Using a spatula, fold the ingredients together, just until
  combined--DON'T OVERMIX. Spoon the mixture into the lined muffin
  tins, filling them evenly, about 3/4 full. Bake for 20-25 minutes,
  testing until a wooden pick comes out clean. Let me know if these
  muffins are what you're looking for.  I have more recipes if they're
  not. Enjoy.......Susan MM Format Norma Wrenn npxr56b

      1 pk Frozen artichoke hearts
        x  Italian herbs
        x  Balsamic vinegar
        x  1 t olive oil
      1    Onion, chopped fine
      3    Garlic cloves Peeled and
           Squinched up into little
           Pieces
      1 lg Package of mushrooms,
           Sliced
    1/2 c  Or so f/f parmesan cheese
      2    Spoonsfuls of f/f mayo and
           F/f sour cream.
      1 ds Worcestershireshshchestshire
           (you know what I mean)
 
  Marinate artichoke hearts with italian herbs and some balsamic
  vinegar. I myself add a teaspoon or so of olive oil (someone will be
  coming to measure me now, I'm sure).
  
  Stir artichoke hearts and rest of ingredients together. DON'T put in
  so much white stuff that it is too moist because the mushrooms will
  release moisture and then it will get gross.
  
  Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes in a French White Corning Ware
  casserole. If you put it in anything else it will explode.
  
  This is great as a dip, or in a pita sandwich.  I hope you like it,
  and I promise not to post too often until I actually learn to measure
  and write :-)

      5    (7 1/2-ounce) cans Mexican
           -abalone
      8 oz Shrimp
      4 oz Fat pork
      4 oz Water chestnuts, minced
        pn Chives
           Ginger water, to taste (see
           -note)
           Salt and MSG
      1 oz Maize (corn) flour
      4 oz Chive and ginger oil
           -(see note)
      2 oz Flour
      3    Eggs, beaten
    5/8 oz Shaoxing wine
      6 oz Chicken stock
 
  The following four recipes are from a Chron article called "Foreign
  Intrigue" by Alice Cuneo that featured recipes from various
  consulates in the City.  This first one is from the Consulate of the
  People's Republic of China.  It's a sophisticated (but uncomplicated)
  banquet dish featuring abalone, shrimp and porkfat.
  
  Abalone stuffed with minced shrimp, from Shen Xuliang of the Chinese
  consulate.
  
  Trim the abalone, removing rough parts, and cut into flat rounds. Chop
  shrimp and fat pork to a paste consistency; stir in the water
  chestnuts, chives and ginger water. Season with salt and MSG.
  
  Create the abalone "sandwiches" by spreading an abalone round with
  shrimp paste, then topping with another round. Dredge "sandwiches" in
  maize flour and set aside.
  
  Heat chive and ginger oil in a wok over medium heat, swirling the oil
  to coat all sides of the wok.
  
  Dip the abalone "sandwiches" in the flour, then in eggs. Fry in the
  hot oil until abalone is tender and golden. Add Shaoxing wine,
  chicken stock, salt and MSG. Bring to a simmer, adjust the seasonings
  and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.  Serve immediately.
  
  NOTE:  Chive and ginger oil is oil in which chives and ginger have
  been cooked.  To make at home, heat 4 ounces oil in a wok set over
  medium heat. Toss in 1 or 2 tablespoons fresh snipped chives and 3
  slices fresh ginger. Stir-fry until fragrant, then proceed with
  recipe. (Remove ginger slices before serving.)
  
  Ginger water is available in Chinese markets.

      4 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
           Salt, pepper

  Note: If abalone is not available, substitute sea scallops cut into
  paper-thin slices. *You may substitute watercress instead of arugula.
  **May use red cabbage instead of radicchio. ***Gingerroot should be
  peeled and grated. Rinse and dry lettuce, arugula and radicchio.
  Discard mushroom stems and slice tops in thin vertical slices. Rinse
  and dry peas. Remove abalone from shells, using handle of heavy spoon
  to break muscle attachments. Reserve shells. Clean abalone well,
  discarding undesirable parts. Clean shells thoroughly, dry and set
  aside. Using meat slicer, slice abalone muscle crosswise into
  tissue-thin pieces. If abalone can't be sliced tissue-thin, slice
  thin as possible and pound each slice on flat surface with mallet or
  flat end of cleaver until tender and almost transparent but not
  shredded. Combine juice of 1 lime, 1 tablespoon grated ginger and
  grind or two of fresh pepper in bowl. Add abalone slices and toss to
  coat well. Marinate 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Combine
  remaining lime juice, remaining ginger, vinegar, soy sauce and 3
  tablespoons olive oil in small bowl. Tear lettuce, arugula and

 Categories: Breakfast, Desserts, Kooknet, Cyberealm
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      1 c  Water
      1    Egg
      2 tb Oil
      3 tb Nonfat Dry Milk Powder
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
      1 ts Salt
  3 1/2 c  Bread Flour
  2 1/2 ts Yeast
    1/2 c  Powdered Sugar
 
  Place all ingredients except sugar in machine. Program for knead and
  first rise and press start. The dough will be sticky at first but
  will hold its shape. After the final cycle, it will be workable. When
  dough is finished, turn the dough out onto a floured surface and let
  it rest for 10 minutes. Roll the dough to a generous 1/4" thick and
  cut it into 2" squares.
  
  Cover the squares with a clean towel and let rise for 30 minutes. Add
  the powdered sugar to a medium-size clean paper bag. Lay out paper
  towels to drain the doughnuts. Heat 1 to 1 1/2 " of oil to 375øF. Do
  not add too many; add once or it may cool the oil too much. Gently
  brush the uncooked squares to remove any extra flour. Slide them into
  the heated oil. When they pop to the surface, spoon the hot oil over
  them constantly until they are puffed. Turn the squares and cook
  until they are a light golden color on both sides. It should take 1
  to 2 minutes. Cut the first couple of squares in half to be sure
  there is not sticky uncooked dough inside.
  
  Remove from hot oil with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
  While warm, drop them, 3 or 4 at a time, into the bag with powdered
  sugar and shake until they are well coated. Serve immediately.

  bread. It's a rustic looking loaf that ought to be just the thing
  with stews or hearty soups. *Rye sarter: 2 c Rye flour, 2 c warm
  water, 1 pkg yeast in a glass container.  Leave at roomtemp for about
  3 days stirring when you think of it.  When it starts to smell like a

  I baked it on the regular bake cycle.  It rose almost to the top of
  the pan and is a lovely golden color. Tastes pretty good, too.

  need to make adaptations for whatever type of b/m you have. Play with
  it, if it looks too sticky, add flour (1 tbsp. at a time.) If too
  dry, add liquid, also one tbsp. at a time. Then let her rip!!!!!!!!
    * Maybe as little as 1/2 c; (I took the chill off of it in the
  microwave) Place ingredients. in the B/M according to your
  manufacturers' directions. Then adjust by adding flour or liquid as
  needed This made a real moist, light lg. loaf. It rose to the top of

  What is a bagel?
  
  A bagel is traditionally a hefty, dense ring of somewhat bland tasting
  bread. But with different flours, such as rye and wheat, bagels take
  on different tastes. Add raisins, blueberries, strawberries, dates
  and nuts for a dessert-like bagel. Add veggies, onions, poppy seeds,
  peanut butter and other ingredients for an infinite variety of taste
  combinations.
  
  The popularity of bagels is as much attributed to what you can put on
  them and in them as to what you add to the unbaked dough. They are
  the perfect vehicles for spreads. Most often spreads consist of a
  cream cheese base that may be mixed with salmon or lox, fruits,
  vegetables and spices -- in myriad combinations. There are regional
  differences in how bagels are made, and ongoing arguments about what
  constitutes the "perfect" bagel and best spread combination.
  
  The traditional bagel sandwich consists of cream cheese, lox, a slice
  of onion and a slice of tomato. But that's only the beginning. Bagel
  sandwiches are so popular that bagel bakeries often list 40 or 50
  sandwich variations on their menus. then there are mini bagels and
  bialys. For catered bagel brunches, there are 3- to 6- pound bagels
  that are filled and then cut into pie shaped wedges.
  
  Bagels have a lot going for them. They don't crush or smash while
  being carried; they don't melt from the heat or suffer from freezing.
  They're at their optimum goodness when fresh and hot from out of the
  oven, but they're delicious, too, even when frozen, thawed and
  toasted. If they get stale, they can be made into bagel chips or
  ground into bread crumbs. They're an all-around convenient, no-waste
  food product that is well suited to today's health conscious
  consumers.
  
  The plain water bagel is low in calories compared to other traditional
  breakfast foods. Estimates as to the number of calories in a bagel
  differ, and its size is a factor. Most bagels weigh 4 to 5 ounces,
  and tally up to between 150 to 200 calories. The addition of nuts,
  raisins, berries, chocolate chips and other ingredients will add to
  the count. I saw a cracked wheat bagel in a health food store that
  had 320 calories. Some bagels weigh 6 ounces. Mini bagels may be 1 to
  3 ounces, so the calories vary accordingly.
  
  It's the toppings and spreads that shoot up the calorie tab, though
  this can be tempered by using light and fat-free cheeses, and spreads
  without cheese. A whopping dollop of cream cheese slapped onto each
  half of a bagel (2 tablespoons of cream cheese have 10 grams of fat
  and 100 calories) will wipe out the innocence of the plain bagel. Two
  tablespoons of regular preserves (there are sugar free varieties,
  too) can add on 50 calories but no fat. And peanut butter? Well, you
  would rather not know, if you're counting calories and grams of fat.
  
  Still, you're better off with bagels than with a doughnut, which has
  176 calories and 11 grams of fat. A homemade bran muffin (not the
  giant restaurant or bakery size) has 112 calories and 5 grams of fat.
  A large croissant has 300 calories, 17 grams of fat and 85 milligrams
  of cholesterol. The butter will do it every time. There is no butter
  in a bagel recipe. Only egg bagels have cholesterol; even that can be
  eliminated using egg whites instead of a whole egg (or 1/4 cup liquid
  egg substitute). But a sweet roll with nut and raisin Danish filing,
  and icing, can top them all with about 360 calories, 2.3 grams of fat
  and 82.2 milligrams of cholesterol.

  The process is simple. Initially, the boiling procedure may seem
  strange, but once you've done it, you'll wonder why you hesitated.
  Just boil a pot of water as you would for spaghetti, and boil the
  shaped bagel for about 2 minutes, turning once. Your first few bagels
  may not come out round and smooth on top, but they'll taste good
  anyway. Be patient. The second batch will look better; by the third,
  you mat think you're ready to go into business.
  
  Basically, these are the basic steps required to make bagels. We'll
  go into each in detail.
  
  1. Mix, knead and first rise: Mix flour, water, salt, sugar (or malt
  or honey) and yeast, knead them and let the dough rise for about an
  hour. Mixing and kneading can be done in a bread machine, a food
  processor, a heavy duty mixer, or by hand. this same procedure is
  used to make any yeast bread.
  
  2. Shape bagels: Form the dough into the traditional bagel shape by
  rolling, poking a hole in a ball or using a bagel cutter.
  
  3. Second rise: Allow a short rest and second rise period, about 20
  minutes.
  
  4. Boil or "kettle": Drop the bagels into boiling water for 1 to 3
  minutes and drain. You can bake immediately or refrigerate for 1 to
       24    hours.
  
  5. Glaze and apply topping: This step is not essential to the final
  product.
  
  6. Bake: Bake in a preheated oven for 20 to 35 minutes.

  STEP 1: MIX, KNEAD AND FIRST RISE:
  
  The Bread Machine:
  
  The bread machine yields excellent results every time when you use
  fresh ingredients and follow directions. Set the machine on "dough
  cycle", and let it produce a dough with the texture of velvet and the
  stiff consistency required.
  
  When using a bread machine, add ingredients in the order recommended
  in your manufacturer's instructions. The recipes in this series have
  ingredients listed for machines that require adding liquids first and
  dry components last.
  
  Reverse the order for those that add dry ingredients first and wet
  ones last. Process on the "dough mode," or "program", or "mix bread
  cycle" or whatever it is termed by your machine's instructions. Allow
  the dough to rise through the full first rise period after the
  kneading phase, between 35 minutes and 1 hour.
  
  On shorter cycles, and depending on the weather and moisture of the
  ingredients, you may have to leave it in the machine for 10 or 15
  minutes longer, or until the dough fills about 2/3 of the pan. Whole
  grain flours may require up to 1 to 2 hours for the first rise. Do
  not allow the dough to bake in the machine.
  
  Dry ingredients such as spices, cinnamon, nutmeg and finely chopped
  nuts are added with the fours at the beginning. Wet ingredients such
  as mashed bananas, applesauce, pumpkin, grated carrots and frozen
  berries are added with the liquids, but if you add more wet
  ingredients to the recipes in this series, their liquid content must
  replace an equal amount of liquid. Adding raisins and other dried
  fruits at the beginning is not recommended; most bread machines
  pulverize them so they're hardly visible in the finished bagel.
  
  Check dough about 5 minutes after you have started the machine. The
  dough should form a nice round ball. If a ball doesn't form, and the
  mixture appears crumbly, add water, a tablespoon or less at a time,
  until the correct consistency is achieved. If dough looks too wet or
  formless, add flour, a tablespoon or less at a time, until the dough
  forms a ball.
  
  Add ingredients such as raisins, dates, chocolate chips and apple
  pieces about 5 to 8 minutes before the end of the kneading phase.
  Some machine beep to indicate the optimum time to add nuts or
  raisins. Check your manufacturers instructions for the time required
  for each process in the dough cycle. If your machine does not provide
  this timed signal, determine the length of the kneading phase and set
  a timer for 5 minutes before the end; then open the machine and
  carefully add the ingredients, being sure that they do not spill onto
  the heating elements. Ingredients can also be kneaded into the dough
  by hand after it is removed from the machine.
  
  NOTE: When adding reconstituted dried foods to the dough in a bread
  machine (5 to 10 minutes before the end of the kneading phase), foods
  should be blotted very dry with a paper towel so that any retained
  moisture does not change the texture of the dough and inhibit it from
  rising properly.
  
  A 60 minute rise period is ideal. It's ok to open the machine and
  quickly test the dough during the rise period. Gently push your
  finger into the dough, and if the dent remains, dough is ready. If
  the impression bounces back, let dough rise a few minutes longer and
  retest. Dough can become slack if allowed to rise too long. White
  flour rises highest. White flour combined with whole wheat, rye and
  oats will not rise as high. Generally, the darker the dough, the
  lower the rise and the longer it takes.
  
  When ready, remove dough form the pan and proceed to step 2: Shape
  Bagels.

  THE FOOD PROCESSOR
  
  A food processor will knead dough ingredients very quickly and
  easily. It will reduce the process to a few minutes, even cutting
  down the time of the a bread machine. Our testers found the results
  extremely reliable. One tester much preferred it to the bread machine
  because he was in charge all the way and never had a failure. By
  mixing and kneading in the food processor and allowing the dough to
  rise in the microwave, bagels can be ready for boiling in under a
  half hour. You can optionally use the microwave for the first rise
  for dough that has been mixed in the bread machine, by hand or with
  an electric mixer. Then work the flavoring ingredients into the dough
  after the first rise as you would for dough made in the bread
  machine. Either active dry yeast or fast-rising yeast can be used.
  
  1. Mix 1/4 of the liquid to 110-115 degrees in the microwave and add
  to the yeast and sugar in a small cup. Mix gently and let sit for 5
  minutes. Pour remaining liquid in a cup and make it very cool, right
  out of the refrigerator, or add an ice cube.
  
  2. Put the metal cutting blade into the food processor bowl. Measure
  flour and salt and put them into the processor bowl. Pulse tow or
  three times, just enough to mix the flour and salt. Add any oil or
  butter and pulse until it disappears, tow or three pulses.
  
  NOTE: Most food processors can mix 3 1/4 to 3 1/2 cups of flour.
  However, it's possible to mix a larger or double batch of dough. If
  the machine balks, it will stop automatically. Let it cool down and
  restart it. Or divide dough in half and continue processing each half
  separately. When mixed, knead the two batches together.
  
  3. Pour yeast mixture into flour through the feeding tube and pulse
  for another 5 or 10 seconds until it forms a ball. Pulse a few more
  times to knead. When dough appears to come away from sides, it is
  ready.
  
  4. Remove dough from the processor bowl and hand-knead to remove any
  gases. Let it rest for about 5 minutes. If it's not elastic enough,
  add a few more drops of water; if it's still too sticky, add a
  sprinkle of flour until it is smooth, velvety and elastic. The first
  rise can be done in a microwave oven in about 15 minutes or in a bowl
  in a draft-free environment for about 1 hour. Microwave ovens vary in
  wattage, so the rise period and settings may vary. You may have to
  experiment.
  
  To use a microwave oven, after the dough is kneaded, carefully remove
  it and the metal blade from the processor bowl. Form dough into a
  rectangle long enough to wrap once around the processor bowl. Grease
  dough with oil or nonstick vegetable spray, but do not cover bowl.
  (Be sure the bowl has no metal parts.) Place the bowl in the
  microwave.
  
  Method 1: Microwave on LOW (30%), or DEFROST (about 30%), for 1
  minute. Let rest for 10 minutes. Repeat microwaving and resting 1 to
  2 times, until the dough has doubled in size. Test with your fingers
  until a dent remains. If the dough springs back and dough has not
  doubled, microwave once more for a few minutes until a dent does
  remain and dough appears doubled in size.
  
  Method 2: Or, place dough in the processor bowl as instructed.
  Position an 8-ounce microwave-safe cup filled with water in the back
  corner of the microwave. cover the processor bowl lightly with a damp
  tea towel or plastic wrap and place it in the microwave on LOW (30%),
  or DEFROST (30%) setting. Heat for 3 minutes, rest for 3 minutes,
  heat for 3 minutes and rest for 6 minutes, repeating the 3-minute
  heat and the 6-minute rest once or twice if necessary, until dough
  has doubled in bulk.
  
  To allow dough to rise in a draft free environment, place dough in a
  large bowl lightly oiled with vegetable oil. Turn dough so all
  surfaces are greased. Cover with plastic wrap sprayed with nonstick
  vegetable spray and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 2
  hours.
  
  Proceed to Step 2: Shape Bagels.

  THE HEAVY DUTY MIXER WITH A DOUGH HOOK
  
  A heavy duty electric mixer with a dough hook will make short work of
  mixing small or large batches of dough quickly.
  
  Combine the warm liquid (110-115 degrees), syrup, honey or sugar, oil
  and yeast, and then add half the flour and all other dry ingredients.
  Add remaining flour until a ball forms.
  
  The dough hook will do part or all of the kneading, which should take
  about 5 minutes. If the dough begins to strain the machine, add more
  water so it becomes softer (check your manufacturer's directions; a
  heavy duty mixer with a dough hook should have no problem kneading).
  When dough appears near desired consistency, remove it from the bowl
  and knead in extra dough until it forms a soft ball. Follow the same
  first rise procedures as in the hand mixing or food processor
  methods. If a fast-rising yeast is used, the first rise is not
  necessary.
  
  Proceed to Step 2: Shape Bagels.
  
  BY HAND:
  
  Mix together warm water (110-115 degrees), yeast and 1 tsp. sugar and
  let stand for 5 minutes. In a large bowl, add remaining sugar, salt
  and 2 cups flour. Stir in the yeast mixture. Add remaining flour,
  stirring to form dough.
  
  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board. Knead dough by hand,
  adding more flour as necessary, for 10 to 15 minutes until dough is
  smooth, shiny, stiff and elastic. Keep the board and your hands
  dusted with flour to prevent sticking.
  
  Knead by pushing down on the dough with the palms of your hands,
  exerting pressure from your shoulders. Lift the dough from the top
  edge, turn it a quarter turn, fold it in half, press again, turn,
  fold, press, and repeat the process until dough forms a cohesive
  ball. When the dough is no longer sticky, stretch it to help develop
  elasticity. Knead it a few more times (by now you should be about
  ready to drop dead and buy frozen Lender's <G>.) Drop it on your
  board, lift it, pick it up again and drop it again, continuing to
  stretch, drop and knead a few more times. If it becomes too stiff,
  add a few drops of water; if too sticky, add a little more flour.
  When optimally kneaded and shaped into a ball, dough will spring back
  when poked gently.
  
  Place dough in a lightly greased bowl. Turn dough so all surfaces are
  greased. cover with a sheet of plastic wrap sprayed with nonstick
  vegetable spray and let rise until doubled in bulk, about an hour.
  the test for proper rising, which about doubles the mass of the dough
  in size, is to poke two fingers lightly and quickly about 1/2" into
  dough. If dent stays, dough is doubled.
  
  Proceed to Step 2: Shape Bagels

  STEP 2: SHAPE BAGELS
  
  Prepare baking sheets by lightly greasing them with nonstick vegetable
  spray, or oil with a little vegetable oil spread with your fingertips
  or waxed paper.
  
  Reach into the bread machine pan and pull dough out (if it is slightly
  sticky, dip your fingers into flour first.) Some machines punch dough
  down automatically at the end of the rise cycle, and just the act of
  removing the dough from the pan is usually adequate to remove gases,
  but you may need to punch dough down to remove any remaining air. Or,
  remove dough from bowl or food processor bowl and punch down.
  
  Knead dough once or twice and let it rest for 5 minutes. If the dough
  is still a little too wet and sticky, lightly flour the bread board
  or your hands and knead the dough manually, until it has a smooth,
  elastic consistency. Bagel dough should be stiff but elastic; if it's
  too stiff, sprinkle a little water on it or moisten your hands and
  knead the moisture into dough. After you've made one or two batches
  of bagels, you'll get the feeling of the ideal consistency.
  
  Roll and pull dough into a rectangle about 10x14" for a 1-pound
  recipe and 14x18" for a 1 1/2-pound recipe, and let it rest for 5
  minutes. Sprinkle with dried fruits, nuts, vegetables, seeds, spices,
  chocolate, or any combination of flavorings. Roll dough into a log
  and knead the ingredients into the dough for a minute or so.
  
  The dough should weigh a little more than the size recipe you are
  using. Divide dough into pieces depending on the size bagel you want.
  A 1 1/2-pound recipe yields 8 to 12 finished bagels, each weighing 2
  to 3 ounces, measuring about 4 inches across. Use a food scale if you
  want consistency, or measure with a ruler. Cut smaller pieces for
  mini bagels. Knead in added ingredients well before shaping each
  bagel. You can also divide dough and add different ingredients to
  each part so you get a varied batch of bagels from one recipe.

  Shape using any of the following methods:
  
  HOLE IN THE MIDDLE METHOD: Roll each piece of dough into a ball, poke
  a floured finger through the center to form the hole, and then shape
  top and smooth sides. Moisten your finger with water, if necessary to
  smooth. Pull gently to enlarge hole. The resulting bagel is smooth
  and there is no joint.
  
  OR, press the round on your floured board. Using the index fingers of
  both hands, poke a hole an pull dough until the hole is large, and
  then round out the bagel and smooth the top and edges.
  
  THE HULA HOOP AROUND THE FINGER METHOD: Create a circle without a
  joint by flattening a ball of dough slightly into a round shape,
  folding the bottom edge under and smoothing it until it looks like a
  mushroom top. With a floured index finger, make a hole in the center
  of the circle from the bottom up. Twirl the circle around your index
  finger, or two fingers, like a hula-hoop, to widen the hole. Pull out
  and shape the round.
  
  THE ROPE METHOD: Roll each piece of dough into a rope by rolling it
  on the bread board or between your hands. Wrap the rope around four
  fingers, overlap and join the ends, and turn the circle inside out.
  Until you get this hand movement down pat, you may have to moisten
  the ends to hold them together. Initially the length may be lumpy and
  the joint will show. It takes practice.
  
  OR, roll dough into 30" lengths, cut each length into thirds (each 10"
  long) and join the ends. If you become proficient at this hand-made
  method, make 10" marks on the edge of your bread board so your bagels
  will be a consistent size.
  
  BAGEL CUTTER METHOD: Roll dough out to a flat shape about 1/2" thick.
  Cut with a bagel cutter and smooth the tops over the sides so they're
  rounded, using a little water on your fingers to smooth, if
  necessary. Knead scraps again, reroll and cut into as many more
  bagels as there is dough. If you don't have a bagel cutter, use a
  wide champagne glass to cut out the outside. Cut the inside hole with
  the edge of a cordial glass or the small end of a measuring jigger.
  Any leftover dough can be rolled into two strips and made into a
  bagel twist (separate recipe), sealing ends with a dab of water so
  they don't untwist while boiling and baking.
  
  Place shaped bagels on the greased baking sheet for the second rise,
  spacing them at least an inch apart to allow for the second rise.
  Proceed to Step 3: Second Rise.
  
  STEP 3: SECOND RISE
  
  During the second rising of the dough, the bagels will puff up on the
  greased baking sheet. cover them with a length of plastic wrap
  sprayed with nonstick vegetable spray or a very lightly dampened
  cloth such as a tea towel. Place them in a draft free location and
  let them rise at room temperature until puffy, about 20 minutes.
  
  NOTE:  Bagels can be refrigerated at this point, should you decide to
  boil and bake them later, or the next morning. Leave them covered so
  they do not dry out. Remove from the refrigerator and allow to warm
  slightly while you boil water and preheat the oven.
  
  The second rise can be speeded up by using the microwave. Fill a 2-cup
  microwave-safe measuring cup with water and bring the water to a boil.
  Place in a corner of the microwave. Place the baking sheet of covered
  bagels in the microwave and close the door, but so not turn on the
  microwave. The bagels should rise in a bout 6 minutes. (It won't
  matter if the sheet is metal because you don't turn on the oven.)
  
  Or, spray shaped tops of dough with water. Place bagels on a
  microwave-safe surface and heat in the microwave on LOW or DEFROST
  setting for 3 minutes; rest for 3 minutes. Repeat heating and resting
  until bagels are puffy.
  
  Proceed to Step 4: Boil or "kettle".

  STEP 4: BOIL OR "KETTLE"
  
  Fill a 4- to 6- quart soup pot with water 3 to 4 inches deep. Water
  alone can be used, or add 2 tbs. malt syrup, honey or sugar.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400F., so it's ready when you're through boiling
  the bagels.
  
  Drop bagels one at a time into the boiling water. Boil about 4 at a
  time or only so many that they float freely and so not crowd; they
  will expand further in the hot water. The bagel may sink to the
  bottom for a few seconds, and then float to the surface. Simmer for
  30 seconds to 1 minute on each side, turning with a slotted spatula.
  Remove and put on a lightly greased rack or a lightly floured tea
  towel for a few minutes to drain.
  
  HINT: Put the top side of the bagel down into water first, and then
  turn over.
  
  When you remove them, the bagels will be top side up and slide off
  your spatula for draining and adding toppings.
  
  When cool enough to handle, proceed to Step 5: Glaze and Apply
  Topping, or if you omit this step, proceed to Step 6: Bake.
  
  STEP 5, OPTIONAL: GLAZE AND APPLY TOPPING
  
  GLAZES: Brush tops with glaze either before placing them in the oven
  or about 5 minutes into the baking and then again about 5 minutes
  before the end of baking. I've tried all the glazes listed below on
  the same bagels in one batch, using white flour bagels and whole
  grain flour bagels. Despite claims in some cookbooks that different
  glazes yield different shades and crustiness, I found no appreciable
  difference in either color or texture of the crusts when applied to
  bagels. You may have a different result.
  
  Water Glaze: A spray or brushing with room-temperature tap water will
  yield a subtle glaze similar to using the steam baking method
  (described elsewhere in
  
  directions). Try brushing some bagels at the beginning of the baking,
  some 5 minutes after and some near the end, and compare the
  differences.
  
  Nonstick Vegetable Spray Glaze: an easy, quick, effective, low calorie
  glaze is a spray of nonstick vegetable spray. It goes on more evenly
  than using a brush, yet yields an even glaze. Spray before placing in
  the oven and again about 5 minutes before baking time is completed.
  
  Melted Butter or Margarine Glaze: This glaze produces the same effect
  as vegetable oil. Watch the bagels carefully so they don't burn.
  
  Egg Glaze #1: Mix together 1 egg white, 1 egg yolk or 1 whole egg
  with 1 tbs. water, milk, or cream.
  
  Egg Glaze #2: Lightly beat 1 egg white. You can brush it on the bagels
  either before they are put into the oven or 5 minutes after baking
  time has begun, and 5 minutes before the baking is finished.
  
  Cornstarch Glaze: Dissolve 2 tbs. cornstarch in 1/4 cup cold water.
  Bring 1 cup water to a boil and whisk the dissolved solution into the
  boiling water until it thickens. This cornstarch mixture can be kept
  in the refrigerator for several days. Brush it on the bagel tops at
  the beginning of the baking and again as soon as you remove the
  bagels from the oven for a very high shine.

  TOPPINGS: A variety of toppings can be added to the bagel before
  baking, either directly to the dough after settling, or after the
  bagel is glazed. Poppy seeds, sesame seeds, caraway seeds and coarse
  salt are easiest to use because they can be placed in a dish directly
  from the jar, and the bagel can be dipped into the dish; the seeds
  adhere to the moist dough. Or they can be sprinkled on top of the
  bagels just before baking, and pressed down lightly to adhere. I've
  seen bagels with sparse toppings and those that are covered from top
  to bottom. There's no right or wrong way.
  
  Add 1/2 cup finely chopped, sautéed onions to the tops of the bagels.
  
  Add 1/2 cup finely chopped raw onions to the tops of the bagels; they
  will cook right along with the bagels.
  
  Use dehydrated onion flakes or packaged onion soup that you have
  reconstituted with water, olive oil, or vegetable oil. Use 1 tbs. dry
  product to 1/2 tbs. water or oil, and soak for 2 to 3 minutes.
  
  Mix together 1/2 cup chopped yellow onions, 1 green onion (white part
  only), 2 tsp. olive oil, 2 tsp. poppy seeds.
  
  Sprinkle with garlic salt, finely chopped fresh garlic or garlic
  flakes.
  
  For the "Everything Bagel" (see recipe), combine 1/2 cup finely
  chopped onions, 1 clove garlic, finely chopped, and 1/4 cup sesame
  seeds. Sprinkle mixture on bagel tops before baking.
  
  Use ground caraway or whole caraway seeds. These are particularly
  good on rye bagels. They can be combined with the topping for the
  "everything bagel".
  
  Sprinkle with red pepper flakes, adjusting the "heat" to your liking.
  
  Top with mixed fresh herbs, including parsley, chives and dill.
  
  Dip into or distribute about 1/4 cup coarse salt or kosher salt on
  top of 1 batch of bagels just before baking.
  
  Poppy, caraway, sesame and celery seeds can be used directly from the
  jar. Just dip the bagels into a dish of seeds or sprinkle seeds on
  top.
  
  Toasting nuts before using them on (and in) bagels enhances their
  flavor. Walnuts, almonds, pecans or hazelnuts can be used on bagels
  as toppings and also added to the dough at the beginning or before
  they are shaped and rise the second time.
  
  Sprinkle with rolled oats or multigrain cereal, which will brown while
  baking.

  STEP 6: BAKE
  
  Place bagels on a shelf just below the middle in a preheated 400F.
  oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the tops are a nice
  golden brown.
  
  BAKING SURFACES:
  
  Bake the bagels on a baking sheet. The easiest surface available to
  most home cooks is an aluminum cookie sheet or flat Teflon-coated
  sheet pan. Coat with a little oil and sprinkle very lightly with
  yellow cornmeal to prevent bagels from sticking. Or line the pan with
  parchment paper; it eliminates the use of oil and cornmeal and
  cleaning pans.
  
  Bake the bagels on wooden boards (described earlier in directions).
  Place bagels on the boards bottom side up to form a crusty bottom,
  and flip them off the board after 2 or 3 minutes onto a stone or
  sheet to continue baking.
  
  Bake the bagels directly on a baking stone or tiles. Place the stone
  or tiles on the lowest rack. Or line a baking sheet with the tiles
  and place that on the lowest rack. Preheat the oven, with stone or
  tiles inside, to 400F. for 1 hour before baking. Sprinkle cornmeal on
  the stone or tiles. Transfer unbaked bagels to the hot surface with a
  wooden peel (a long-handled wooden paddle used in baking), or any
  flat instrument with a long handle so you don't burn yourself; wear
  heavy padded gloves.
  
  Do not wash or immerse stone or tiles in cold water while they are
  hot; they may crack. Soak the cooled stone or tiles in cold water and
  scrape with a spatula. Do not use soap, as the surfaces tend to
  absorb soap, which will be imparted to the bagels. Stones and tiles
  will discolor, but that won't affect their baking ability. Don't
  place a hot stone directly on your kitchen counter; depending on the
  material, the heat could leave a mark.
  
  Steam baking gives bagel tops a crisp crust and extra shine. Create
  steam during the first few seconds of the baking by spraying the
  sides of the preheated oven with water from a spray bottle when you
  place the bagels inside. Place a heavy pan in the lower part of the
  oven bottom while it is heating. Place the bagels in the oven and
  then pour cold water or half a dozen ice cubes into the pan.
  
  STORING AND USING BAGELS:
  
  Bagels are best when they're eaten fresh from the oven while still
  warm. Because they don't usually contain egg or milk, they tend to
  dry out faster than breads that contain these ingredients. If you
  can't consume all the bagels in a reasonably short time, freezing
  them is recommended. It's smart to slice them horizontally before
  freezing so you can toast only half at a time, if you wish.
  
  Thaw bagels on the kitchen counter in a plastic bag for about 15
  minutes or toast directly from the freezer. Or zap them in the
  microwave oven for about 1 minute on DEFROST and then toast them
  until lightly browned on top. Microwaving too long will make them
  tough.
  
  What if a few bagels get stale? Put them into your blender or food
  processor and grind them into bread crumbs. None of the tasty bread
  need ever go to waste!

  Subject: WHAT DID I DO WRONG?
  
  JC> This past Friday I made my first attempt in many years to
  barbecue JC> a rump roast. JC> I placed it on the spit over medium
  coals, using a meat JC> thermometer. It roasted for about 2 hours
  before reaching the JC> medium setting, at which time I removed it
  from the grill ... JC> When the meat was sliced the center was a nice
  medium pink. JC> The meat was tough as a piece of shoe leather.  What
  could I have JC> done wrong, or was it just a case of a bad piece of
  meat to begin JC> with?
  
  From:    Kathy Pitts
  
  Tough to tell long-distance, Jean, but I'd say the problem was too
  hot a fire.  Rump isn't the tenderest meat in the world to begin
  with, and if you subject it to too much heat too fast, the connective
  tissues are going to tighten up, forcing the moisture out, and
  resulting in a dry, tough hunk of cow.
  
  Next time, try roasting the meat in an pan, rather than the
  rotisserie, building your fire by making SMALL mounds of coals on
  either side of the roast (no heat directly below). If you like, you
  can place the roast directly on the grids of your grill, placing the
  pan in the center of the firebox to act as a buffer for the coals.
  
  Place a cover over the roast (if your grill doesn't have a cover, you
  can improvise one with some heavy wire and heavy-duty aluminum foil.)
  The heat from the coals should only result in an interior cooking
  temperature of 250-300 degrees.  If it goes down further, don't
  panic. Anything above 200 will cook the meat eventually, and the
  slower the better in this case.
  
  You also might try using a more acid marinade (wine, beer, lemon or
  lime juice in the marinade).  The acid will tenderize the meat
  somewhat (don't expect miracles, though).
  
  Good luck, and let us all know how the next one turns out.
  
  Kathy in Bryan, TX
  
  From:    Dave Sacerdote
  
  I've found the most common cause of a tough roast isn't the cut of
  meat or how you cook it, it's how you SLICE it.
  
  When you carve, make sure you're cutting across the grain of the
  meat. With a tied roast, this usually means that you have to change
  the angle of your cuts as you go along.
  
  As for the dryness:  I like to slightly undercook a roast when I do
  it on the grill's rotisserie.  The meat continues to cook for a few
  minutes after coming off the heat, as you know. Letting the roast
  rest for that time, like you did, usually gives it enough time to
  "finish off" without drying too much.  Remember that when you're
  rotisserie cooking, the fat side of the roast doesn't baste the meat
  nearly as much as a standing roast where the fat side stays on top
  throughout the whole time.

      Title: ABOUT CANNING
 Categories: Info, Canned, Jw
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  Great care must be taken in canning to avoid spoilage. Non-acid foods
  require special care to avoid deadly botulism and require pressure
  cooking not just a boiling water bath.
  
  Check the elasticity of the sealing rubbers and discard cracked ones.
  Do not re-use old ones. Wash them in soap and hot water, rinse and
  place in a pan covering them with boiling water. Leave them soaking
  in the hot water until used.
  
  Check the jars for cracks and chips. Test the jars by filling with
  water and inverting; watch for leaks. Sterilize for 15 minutes in
  boiling water.
  
  Can only fresh, unblemished produce. Wash well to remove all dirt.
  Many foods require blanching to partially cook them and kill enzymes.
  Immerse in boiling water for 5 minutes, then plunge into cold water
  to arrest cooking. Tomatoes, berries and soft fruit do not need
  blanching. Meats should be 2/3 cooked by simmering or roasting.
  
  Add salt in the ratio of 1 tsp per quart for meats and vegetables Use
  a sugar syrup for fruits and add lemon juice or ascorbic acid to avoid
  discoloration. See "About Jams, jellies and preserves"
  
  Pack jars tightly to 1/2" from the top but do not crush the contents.
  Exception: peas, lima beans and corn need more room to expand; fill
  to 1" from the top and add boiling water to the 1/2" mark.
  
  Stir the contents to release trapped air bubbles before sealing the
  jars. Wet the rubber before using.
  
  Follow the manufacture's instructions that come with the pressure
  canner and add 1/2 lb pressure per 1000' in high altitudes. Use a
  boiling water bath only for tomatoes, acid fruits and brined
  vegetables. Use a rack to keep the jars off the bottom where they can
  overheat and crack. The water should be at least an inch over the
  jars at all times. Add 1 minute per 1000' feet for high altitudes.
  
  Store the finished product in a cool dark pantry or cellar. Berries,
  cherries and currants: Pack jars with washed, stemmed fruit and fill
  the jars with boiling medium syrup [3 cups sugar to 4 cups water
  brought slowly to a boil while stirring]. Process 15 minutes in a
  boiling water bath. [Cherries should either be pitted OR have their
  skins pierced with a pin if canned whole].
  
  Peaches: Scald to loosen skins. Peel and half, removing pits. Use
  medium syrup and process 20 min. in boiling water bath.
  
  Tomatoes: Scald and dip in cold water before skinning. Cut out cores
  but leave whole. Pack and fill jars with boiling water. Process 45
  min.in a boiling water bath.

 Categories: Beverages, Crocker
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           See Below
 
  Start with a thoroughly clean coffee maker. Wash after each use with
  hot, soapy water and rinse well with hot water; never scour with an
  abrasive pad. When cleaning an automatic coffee maker, follow the
  manufacturer's directions.
  
  Always use fresh coffee and freshly drawn cold water. Never use hot
  water, especially in automatic coffee makers; it changes percolating
  time.
  
  Serve steaming-hot coffee as soon as possible after brewing. If
  coffee must stand any length of time, remove grounds and hold coffee
  at serving temperature over very low heat.
  
  Keep ground coffee tightly covered.
  
  PREPARATION METHODS Automatic: Follow manufacturer's directions for
  selecting grind of coffee (special ones are available), measuring and
  brewing the coffee and holding the coffee at serving temperature.
  
  Drip: Measure cold water and heat to boiling. Preheat coffeepot by
  rinsing with very hot water. Measure drip-grind coffee into filter
  paper in cone or into filter section of coffee-pot depending on the
  type of drip pot used. Pour measured fresh boiling water into upper
  container; cover. When dripping is completed, remove upper container
  and filter section.

  Blueberries freeze very well.  Simply sort the fruit, don't wash, and
  pack in freezer bags or boxes. When you use the frozen fruit, simply
  wash in running water and use. Don't thaw. This is especially nice
  when adding blueberries to fruit salad or muffins where you don't
  want the rest of the product to turn purple. If you've already washed
  the berries, let them dry before freezing. My favorite way to eat
  blueberries is "straight up." For breakfast try the berries in rice
  (brown, white, what ever) with a little cinnamon and/or clove.

      Title: ABOUT JAMS  JELLIES & PRESERVES
 Categories: Jam, Jelly, Fruits, Preserves
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  The less sugar you use the greater the flavor impact of the fruit. If
  honey is used there will be a flavor change and the jellies/jams must
  be cooked longer. If you use artificial sweeteners use only the
  Cyclamate type to avoid bitterness and follow the manufacturer's
  instructions. Cooked down jellies in which the juice is extracted by
  the open kettle method contain 60% fruit versus commercial products
  [pressure cooked to extract more juice but pectin destroying] with
  only 45%
  
  Jelly: has great clarity from dripping the cooked fruit through a
  cloth before adding sugar and finishing.
  
  Jams, Butter and Pastes: are whole fruit purees of increasing density.
  
  Marmalades, Preserves and Conserves: are bits of fruit in a heavy
  syrup.
  
  High Pectin Fruits: Apples, Crabapples, Quinces, Red Currants,
  Gooseberries, Plums and Cranberries. These need no additional pectin.
  If you get syrupy jelly you used too much sugar or did not cook the
  juice long enough after adding the sugar.
  
  Low Pectin Fruits: Strawberries, Blueberries, Peaches, Apricots,
  Cherries, Pears, Blackberries, Raspberries, Grapes, Pineapple and
  Rhubarb. These require combining with high pectin fruits or adding a
  commercial pectin.
  
  To Test Pectin Content: Put 1 tbl cooled fruit juice in a glass. Add
  an equal amount of grain alcohol and shake gently. The alcohol will
  bring the pectin together in a gel. If a large amount of pectin is
  present it will appear in a single mass or clot when poured from the
  glass. Use equal amounts of juice and sugar. If the pectin collects
  in several small particles use have as much sugar as juice.
  
  To sterilize jelly glasses: fill jars 3/4 full of water and place
  them in a shallow pan partly filled with water. Simmer 15 min and
  then keep hot until filled. If the lids are placed on the steaming
  jars they will be sterilized simultaneously.
  
  Tips: -Use enamel or stainless steel pots not aluminum or copper.
        -On average, use 3/4 c sugar to 1 c fruit or juice depending on
         pectin content[see above].
        -Very acid fruits can tolerate a whole c of sugar.
        -Sterilize jars and seal tightly.
        -For fruit that tends to discolor add lemon juice or Ascorbic
  acid.
        -Keep in a cool dark place but do not refrigerate.
  
  Making Jam: is easiest and most economical as it needs only one
  cooking step and uses the pulp. Measure the fruit. In putting it in
  the pan, crush the lower layers to provide moisture until more is
  drawn out by cooking or add a little water. Simmer the fruit until it
  is soft. Add sugar and stir until dissolved. Bring to a boil,
  stirring to avoid sticking. Reduce heat and cook until thickened- up
  to 1/2 hr.
  
  Making Preserves and Conserves: Place fruit in a pot with an equal
  amount of sugar in layers ending with sugar on top and allow to rest
  overnight. Bring slowly to a boil and simmer until fruit is
  translucent. Drain fruit and put in sterile jars. Simmer syrup longer
  if necessary to thicken it and pour over fruit. Seal and store.
  
  Making juice for jelly: Wash and drain fruit. Prick or crush the
  fruit. Add water if fruit is not juicy enough eg. apples. Add enough
  to the kettle that you can see it through the fruit but the fruit is
  not floating. Cook uncovered until the fruit is soft and loosing its
  color. Have ready a jelly bag [several layers of cheese cloth] . Wet
  it, wring it out and line a strainer with it. Let the juice drip
  through without squeezing it as this muddies and flavors the jelly.
  This juice can be kept up to 6 months before proceeding by freezing
  or canning it.
  
  Making jelly: Measure the strained juice and put it in an enamel or
  stainless steel pan. Simmer 5 min. Skim off froth. Measure and warm
  sugar in a pan in the oven and add it. Stir until dissolved. Cook at
  a gentle simmer until the point of jelling. To test, place a small
  amount of jelly on a spoon, cool it slightly and let it drop back
  into the pot from the side of the spoon. As the syrup thickens, 2
  large drops will form along the edge of the spoon. when these two
  drops run together and fall as a single drop the "sheeting" stage has
  been reached- 220 to 222 deg F and the jelly will be firm when
  cooled. It can take anywhere from 10 to 30 min for jelly to reach
  this stage depending on the fruit and the amount of sugar. Take the
  jars from the sterilizing bath and invert on a cake cooler. They
  should be hot but dry when filled. Fill to 1/4" from the top. Cover
  with melted paraffin 1/8" deep.

           Milkweed buds
           ;Boiling water
           Butter; to taste
 
  Unopened buds are delicious when cooked but must be treated first to
  remove bitterness.  Put them in a pot, pour on boiling water, boil
  one minute, drain, and pour on more boiling water. Repeat this
  process three times or until no bitterness remains when you taste
  them. Cook them a little longer until just tender and serve with
  butter.
  
  Reader Jean McLain of Peoria, IL wrote "The Herb Companion" and
  asked: "Any ideas what can be done to use milkweed blossoms? The
  fragrance is musky but not unpleasant. Could they be used in
  moth-repellant bags?" HC responded with the above recipe and said
  they could find no mention of any use of the blossoms as a moth
  repellent.

      Title: ABOUT MISO
 Categories: Text file, Digest
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Text file
 
  The best resource on Miso that I know of is Shurtleff and Aoyagi's
  book _The Book of Miso_.  It's quite a complex subject. The
  differences is miso can be attributed to a variet of factors, from
  the proportion of ingredients, cooking techniques, and duration and
  temperature of fermentation.  The redish color comes from long
  fermentation times (or in cheap imitations, from dyes). The whiter
  misos are generally fermented for short times, and often made with
  rice in addition to soybeans. Reds are generally saltier and whites
  sweeter.
  
  Misos vary widely in fat content (like most soy products) and
  generally range from .25 to 1.5 gram of fat per tablespoon (and from
  about 6%CFF to over 30%CFF). Some varieties, like peanut miso,
  obviously have even more fat.  Since it is rare that a dish has more
  than 1 T miso per serving, miso does not generally add appreciable
  fat to a dish. Many of the white sweet misos clock in at the low end
  (.25 grams per T, 6-10%CFF) so if you do want to use more miso, these
  kinds can be added liberally to a dish (and since their taste isn't
  as strong or salty, they do become many dishes in greater quantity).
  
  I find the dark, hearty misos make great gravy starters. Add a bit of
  water/stock, some nutritional yeast, spices and a thickener to some
  miso and voila, instant delicious gravy. A favorite miso-potato
  recipe follows.
  
  ~- Michelle Dick artemis@rahul.net
  
  On miso, you just have to try different kinds & brands. There are
  numerous styles of miso.  Red misos tend to be more "savory" and
  white ones are usually more "sweet". Country-style (Inaka) is made
  grainier on purpose. If served as a sauce on veggies, probably it's
  not straight miso but mixed w/sugar and some rice vinegar. BTW a
  warning to vegetarians, some misos come "dashi-iri" which includes
  fish-based stock.  I think the ingredients label in English will
  mention fish, but not sure (since I can read the Japanese, I don't
  usually check the English), so check the ingredients carefully.
  There is kombu-dashi (I even found some granulated packets) which is
  vegetarian, but most dashi is from bonito flakes (I guess it must be
  cheaper).

      Title: ABOUT MOLE
 Categories: Info, Mexican
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  Mole (pron. mole-a) is a series of Mexican sauces that contain ground
  chiles, spices, nuts, often chocolate, sometimes raisins, ground
  seeds, etc.
  
  There are three basic types of moles:
  
  1.  Mole Poblano (the most famous type, and the one that ALWAYS
  contains chocolate) was originated in Pueblo during Colonial times
  (Mexican colonial, not ours) by the nuns who wanted to make a special
  dish for a visiting Archbishop.  The sauce contains ground dried
  chile peppers, ground nuts, ground raisins, broth, chocolate,
  sometimes ground corn tortillas, a small amount of sugar, and various
  spices. It is traditionally served over turkey, with a side dish of
  unfilled tamales (just the cornmeal masa steamed in corn shucks.)
  It's one of those dishes that rarely finds its way out of the country
  of origin, and you either passionately love or passionately hate. I'd
  post a recipe if I could find one (Have recipes for all three
  versions floating around SOMEWHERE, but never got the time to enter
  'em into the computer, so they're a little tough to find). It may
  also be purchased pre-made (something I recommend, as the bottled
  version is excellent, and this is NOT something you'd want to attack
  from scratch on even a semi-regular basis). If Shirley is interested,
  I'll pick up a jar and ship it your way.
  
  2.  Mole Verde (green mole) contains green chiles, broth, ground
  pumpkin seeds, various herbs and spices. It's usually served over
  chicken or pork. Nice stuff, and much easier for the beginner to like
  than the Mole Poblano.
  
  3.  Mole Roja (red mole) is a sauce that contains red chiles, herbs
  and spices, ground nuts or seeds, ground corn tortillas, usually no
  chocolate. I THINK it comes from the region around Oxaca. Again, it's
  marginally easier to like than the more well-known version. It's
  usually served over chicken or pork.
  
  All of these dishes are virtual throwbacks to the complex (and to our
  palates unusual) combinations of ingredients that were common in that
  part of the country before the arrival of the Spaniards. None of the
  dishes is particularly hot, they have a complex, haunting flavor that
  speaks of cultures long gone, but not entirely forgotten.
  
  Don't know if you'd like 'em or not, Unka Burt (I do), but if you
  want just a hint of what I'm talking about, throw a square of
  unsweetened chocolate in your next batch of Left-Handed Chili, and
  let us know what you think.

      Title: ABOUT PICKLING
 Categories: Info, Pickles, Joy, Jw
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  Although many vitamins and minerals are leached away in the process,
  pickles remain popular as piquant side dishes and relishes long after
  more efficient food preservation techniques such as refrigeration,
  freezing and canning surplanted this pioneer mainstay as a primary
  food storage method.
  
  Short Brine Pickling:
  
  In this process the vegetables are soaked in brine 24 hours to draw
  out moisture but they are not fermented. To keep, they must have
  boiling hot vinegar poured over them which penetrates and preserves
  as well as crisping them. The final step after jarring and sealing is
  a 15 minute boiling water bath to kill any enzymes. If pickles show
  evidence of fermentation after being stored away [bubbles or leakage]
  either discard or immediately re-pickle.
  
  Because of the acids involved use stoneware, pottery, glass and
  enamel or stainless steel kettles. For stirring and transferring use
  a long handled stainless or wooden slotted spoon. Make sure all
  equipment is clean and grease free. Pickles should be stored in
  sterilized glass jars with glass lids. For sterilizing techniques,
  refer to "About Jams, Jellies and Preserves". [Posted by me last week]
  
  Fruits and vegetables should be very fresh, in prime condition without
  blemishes or bruises and scrubbed dirt free.
  
  Garlic should be blanched 2 minutes before adding or removed before
  jarring.
  
  Spices should be whole not ground and in a removable spice bag.
  
  Water should be low iron, low sulphur and soft. It can be softened
  with up to 1 tablespoon calcium oxide [lime] per quart. If your water
  supply is inadequate buy distilled water or collect rain water.
  
  Salt should be additive free Pickling salt. Regular table salt will
  cloud the liquid.
  
  Vinegar should be 6% acetic acid. Use white distilled vinegar not
  cider, wine or flavored vinegars.
  
  Lime water or cherry and grape leaves in the liquid will make pickles
  crisp. Use alum sparingly if at all and do not use the Copper Sulfate
  called for in old fashioned recipes as it is mildly poisonous in
  excessive amounts.
  
  Pickles should be stored at least 6 weeks to achieve maximum flavor
  and although they will keep for years should be consumed within one
  year as the flavor will deteriorate over time.
  
  This is based on extracts from the Joy of Cooking with amendments and
  additions by Jim Weller.

      Title: ABOUT PORK CHOPS
 Categories: Pork, Info
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  SS> But I don't even bother buying pork chops any more, I don't want
  SS> to put leather on the table.  :(
  
  Don't know if you caught my post to Marlon or not, Sylvia, but the
  problem is not with you, it's with the pork. Now that pork producers
  are looking for a leaner, lighter product, pork requires much less
  cooking than is recommended in most cookbooks.  Most cookbook authors
  recommend cooking pork to an internal temperature of 160-175 to
  eliminate any possible danger of trichinosis (a problem that's been
  eliminated in commercially produced pork anyway). These temperatures
  are WAY too high for the leaner version, which tends to resemble shoe
  leather if treated this way. Try cooking your chops to an internal
  temperature of 140 or so instead (still well done, but not
  overcooked), and you'll have MUCH better results.
  
  My favorite thing to do with pork chops is to stuff 'em. Allow one
  double-thick pork chop or two thinner chops for each person you're
  feeding.
  
  Make a stuffing with cornbread (or one of the cornbread stuffing
  mixes), chopped onion, chopped celery, a small can of whole kernal
  corn, a bit of chicken broth.  Simmer the onion and celery in the
  broth until tender, and add the remaining ingredients. Season to
  taste with salt, black pepper, a generous amount of either sage or
  thyme.
  
  If using double-thick chops, cut a deep pocket in the chop, and
  insert the stuffing.  If using thinner chops, don't stuff yet. Either
  way, melt a small amount of shortening in a frying pan, and quickly
  brown the chops (brown thinner chops on one side only).
  
  Place the chops in an oven-proof baking dish.  (If using thin chops,
  place one chop, browned side down in the dish, top with a scoop of
  stuffing, and top with another chop, browned side up).
  
  Place just enough liquid in the pan to cover the pan bottom, cover
  the pan, and bake in a 350 degree oven until the chops reach an
  internal temperature of 140 (35-60 minutes, depending on the
  thickness of the meat).
  
  Any leftover stuffing can be baked separately.
  
  I usually make a pan gravy with the drippings from browning the
  chops, plus some flour and chicken broth (pork stock would be better,
  but I never seem to have any
  :-).  If you don't want gravy, just deglaze the baking dish with more
  chicken stock, and spoon this liquid over the chops.
  
  Sorry not to offer an official recipe here, but this is one of those
  home-style dishes that I just throw together. Have never measured
  anything for it, and I suspect it's never QUITE the same any time I
  make it. Good stuff, though.  At least it's one of Mooseface's
  favorites :-)

 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Info/tips
 
 
  "Some of the most common kinds of pulses used in Indian cooking are as
  follows:
  
  Chana dal (or gram dal) are hulled and split chick-peas. Deep yellow
  in color, these pulses do not need soaking before cooking."
  
  "Kabli chana are yellow chick-peas. Unhulled and beige in color, they
  need overnight soaking before cooking.
  
  "Kala chana are small brown or black chick-peas. Like kabli chana,
  they require long presoaking and cooking to become tender.
  
  "Continental masoor are whole greenish-brown lentils. Flat and
  oval-shaped, they originated in the West and were adopted by India,
  so they should already be fairly familiar to you. They do not need
  presoaking."
  
  "Masoor are brown Indian lentils. Whole but smaller than continental
  masoor, they do not require presoaking.
  
  "Masoor dal are split masoor which are tiny and salmon-pink because
  they have also been hulled. They do not need presoaking and turn
  yellow when they cook.
  
  "Moong beans (or hari dal) are dark green, small, and slightly
  cylindrical in shape. They need 2-4 hours' soaking before cooking,
  but if oversoaked they will sprout and become moong bean sprouts so
  familiar in the West."
  
  "Moong dal chilka are split moong beans, green on one side and pale
  on the other. They do not need presoaking.
  
  "Moong dal are split, light yellow, and rectangular in shape because
  they are hulled. They do not need to be soaked before cooking.
  
  "Toor dal (or arhar dal) are a hulled, split pulse, a little larger
  than chana dal. Dull and yellow-colored, they do need presoaking."
  
  "Urid (or black matpe) are small, dull, and black, similar in size and
  shape to moong beans. They must be presoaked.
  
  "Urid dal are split urid that do not need to be soaked before cooking.
  
  "Washed urid dal are off-white because they have been hulled and
  washed as well as split. They do not require presoaking."

      Title: ABOUT QUICK BREADS
 Categories: Breads, Crocker
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           See Below
 
  As their name suggests, quick breads are just that-fast and very easy
  to make. Quick breads range from pancakes to tender, flaky biscuits
  to moist, rich nut breads.
  
  Quick-acting baking powder rather than slower-acting yeast is the
  leavening agent for quick breads. It consists of an acid, such as
  cream of tartar, and an alkali, such as baking soda, which react with
  one another in the presence of moisture to form a gas. In batter or
  dough this gas forms tiny bubbles that expand quickly, creating the
  structure of the quick bread. To be sure it is always fresh, purchase
  only a small quantity of baking powder at a time.
  
  BAKING TIPS
  
  Use shiny pans and cookie sheets, which reflect heat, for golden,
  delicate and tender crusts on muffins, coffee cakes and nut breads.
  
  Grease only the bottoms of muffin cups; muffins will then be nicely
  shaped and have no rim around the top edge.
  
  Grease only the bottoms of loafpans for fruit or nut breads. The
  ungreased sides provide a surface for the batter to cling to while
  rising during baking, which helps form a gently rounded top.
  
  Cool nut breads completely before slicing to prevent crumbling. Cut
  with a sharp, thin-bladed knife, using a light sawing motion.

      Title: ABOUT RED MULBERRY
 Categories: Info, Fruits, Jw
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  How to Recognize: The only mulberry native to Canada, it is a short-
  trunked deciduous tree under 30 feet in height. The bark is reddish
  brown, separating in long, flaky plates. The yellowish green leaf
  blades are large, up to 5" long, widest below the middle and have
  hairy undersides. They are simple with pointed tips and the stems are
  long with 3 prominent veins at the base of each leaf. Male and female
  flowers are borne in separate clusters appearing with or before the
  first leaves. The fruits are dark red to black compact aggregates
  which resemble blackberries.
  
  White mulberry is an Asian tree whose foliage is used for silkworm
  feed and has been introduced as an ornamental and is an escapee
  throughout eastern North America. It has lustrous smooth leaves and
  whitish or reddish fruit.
  
  Where to Find: Southernmost Ontario in moist, rich soils often mixed
  with other hardwoods.
  
  How to Use: Harvest easily by spreading sheets under the tree and
  shaking the branches gently. Juicy and sweet when ripe; delicious
  raw, in fruit beverages, or in baked desserts. Alone or in
  combination with acid fruits such as gooseberries or cherries. Can be
  frozen or dried like raisins. Use as in blackberry and raspberry
  recipes.
  
  WARNING: Be careful not to eat raw fruit before it is ripe. Unripe
  fruit and the milky sap in the leaves and stems are toxic and can
  cause gastric upsets. The leaves and stems may also cause dermatitis
  if touched by susceptible individuals. From: Edible Wild Fruits and
  Nuts of Canada,

      Title: ABOUT SHRIMP
 Categories: Shellfish, Info
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  If I may, I'd like to give you some unsolicited advice on handling
  your shrimp.  The better it's treated, the better it's going to taste
  in the end.
  
  1.  Only defrost the quantity you're going to use at any one time (I'm
  hoping here that the shrimp arrived frozen in manageable blocks. If
  not, place it in your refrigerator until it's thawed enough to
  portion, but still icy and essentially frozen.  Portion and re-freeze
  what you're not going to use immediately).
  
  2.  Thaw the shrimp in the refrigerator or in a bucket, by running
  COLD running water over it. If you use the cold water method, allow
  the water to run over the top of the bucket and into the sink, to
  ensure a constant supply of fresh water (the temperature of the
  thawing water should never exceed 70 degrees, and the temperature of
  the thawed shrimp should never exceed 40 degrees.) If your tap water
  is hotter, add ice to the thawing shrimp.  If the shrimp exceeds 40
  degrees, place it in a bath of half ice and half COLD water, and
  refrigerate until it comes down to below 40. Store thawed shrimp
  under refrigeration in a mixture of half shrimp, half ice.
  
  3.  To peel, devein your shrimp, go to your local seafood market or
  gadget center, and pick up a nifty little gadget called a
  "shrimptool". It will cost a couple of dollars, and for the quantity
  of shrimp we're talking about here, it's worth it.
  
  4.  If you want to peel/devein the shrimp for a recipe, keep the
  unpeeled shrimp on ice as you work with it. Do not let the
  temperature exceed 40 degrees.  Drop your peeled, deveined shrimp
  into an ice water bath until you're ready to use it.  Peeled deveined
  shrimp may be held this way for up to 24 hours without much loss in
  flavor/texture.
  
  This seems like a lot of trouble, but shrimp begins to lose
  flavor/texture almost immediately once it gets the least bit warm.
  Health/safety questions aside, the ice method, while troublesome,
  results in a MUCH better tasting end product.
  
  One other tip -- the iodine in the shrimp will be irritating to your
  hands, if you handle a large quantity at a time. To avoid this, soak
  your hands in a strong solution of baking soda and water after
  working with large amounts.
  
  Finally, a quick recipe for fried shrimp that we enjoy:
  
  Go to the store and purchase a package of tempura batter mix. Make
  the mix according to package directions, substituting cold beer (or
  cold club soda, if you prefer to avoid alcohol) for the water called
  for in the recipe.
  
  Dip butterflied peeled, deveined shrimp in the batter, and fry in hot
  deep fat until light gold (it won't and shouldn't get deep brown).
  
  The leftover batter makes unbelievable onion rings.

      Title: ABOUT TEA
 Categories: Beverages, Crocker
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           See Below
 
  The tea you buy is a delicate blend of some 20 to 30 varieties.
  Quality varies according to the soil, climate and altitude in which
  it is grown and the age and size of the leaves when they are picked.
  
  Broadly classified, there are three types: black, oolong and green.
  
  Black tea derives its color from a special processing treatment in
  which the leaves are allowed to oxidize. This turns the leaves black
  and produces a rich brew.
  
  Oolong tea is semioxidized. Its leaves are brown and green. It brews
  light in color.
  
  Green tea is not oxidized, thus the leaves remain green. The brew is
  pale green in color.
  
  PREPARATION METHOD Whether you use loose tea or tea bags, the
  preparation method is the same:
  
  Start with a spotlessly clean teapot made of glass, china or
  earthenware. Add rapidly boiling water; allow to stand a few minutes,
  then pour out.
  
  Heat cold water to a full rolling boil.
  
  Add tea or bags to the warm pot, allowing 1 teaspoon of loose tea or
  1 tea bag for each cup of tea desired. Pour boiling water over tea
  (3/4 cup for each cup of tea); let stand 3 to 5 minutes to bring out
  the full flavor. Stir the tea once to ensure uniform strength.
  
  Do not judge the strength of tea by its color; You must taste it.
  
  Strain the tea or remove tea bags. Serve with sugar and milk or lemon
  if desired.
  
  Prepare instant tea, a concentrate, according to the directions on
  the jar.

      Title: ABOUT VANILLA BEANS
 Categories: Information, Vanilla
      Yield: 1 Info file
 
           Information only
 
  Information from the 1996 Old Farmer's Almanac, "What You Can Eat To
  Achieve True Peace of Mind", by Ken Haedrich
  
  The vanilla orchid is a member of the plant family known as
  Orchidaceae and is the only orchid that produces edible fruit. The
  beans grow on a thick vine that flourishes in warm, moist climates
  within 25 degrees of the equator.  The vanilla plant begins to bear
  fruit when it is three or four years old.  Eight to nine months after
  pollination, the beans are golden yellow and ready for harvest and
  curing.
  
  It takes about five to six pounds of green, freshly picked vanilla
  beans to make one pound of properly cured beans. There are basically
  two ways to cure the beans: in the sun or over a fire. Using the
  solar method, beans are spread in the hot sun by day and wrapped in
  blankets and placed in wooden boxes by night. The sweating process is
  repeated over and over for six months, until the beans have lost up
  to 80 percent of their moisture content.  This method produces
  superior results and is used in Madascar, Mexico, the former Bourbon
  Islands, Tonga, and Tahiti.
  
  The wood-fire curing method, used in Indonesia and Bali, takes only
  two or three weeks, but produces a dry, brittle bean with a smoky
  flavor, generally considered inferior.
  
  When you buy a vanilla bean at your market, the black, oily, smooth
  pod you're buying is a cured bean.  When you purchase a bottle of
  pure vanilla extract, you're buying beans whose flavor components
  have been dissolved in a solution of water and alcohol.  By law, pure
  vanilla extract must contain at least 35 percent alcohol by volume.
  Anything less is labeled a flavor. Pure vanilla extracts come in a
  variety of folds, or strengths. The Food and Drug Administration has
  established that a fold of vanilla is the extractive matter of 13.35
  ounces of vanilla beans to a gallon of liquid. Strong, pure extracts,
  such as four-fold, are primarily used in mass food production.
  
  What about imitation vanilla? ~----------------------------
  
  Not only is pure vanilla expensive, but demand also far exceeds the
  world's supply of the real thing. Stepping in to fill the void is the
  chemist, who has come up with a variety of imitations made from
  synthetic vanillin, the organic component that gives vanilla its
  distinctive flavor and fragrance. Most synthetic vanillin is a
  byproduct of the paper industry, made by cooking and treating
  wood-pulp effluent. But since vanillin is only one of more than 150
  flavor and fragrance compounds found in pure vanilla, the chemist has
  yet to match the subtlety with which Mother Nature has endowed the
  real thing.
  
  How to tell a good bean when you see one.
  ~----------------------------------------
  
  Quality is key.  To truly experience all the flavor and fragrance
  vanilla has to offer, you have to seek out quality beans and
  extracts. Generally speaking, look for beans that are supple and
  aromatic. Tahitian beans are moister and relatively short and plump,
  with thin skins and a floral aroma. Bourbon beans (so called because
  they originate in Madagascar, Reunion, and the Comoros, formerly
  known as the Bourbon Islands) are slightly dryer, contain more
  natural vanillin, and have thick skins (the flavor has nothing to do
  with bourbon whiskey.) Stay away from dry, brittle, or smoky-smelling
  beans.  Depending upon quality and variety, single vanilla beans
  retail from about $1.50 to $10 apiece. Vanilla beans should be kept
  at room temperature in an airtight container. Don't refrigerate them
  or they may develop mold. Vanilla beans last up to two years.
  
  Especially if you cook with it often, it is more economical to buy
  pure vanilla extract by the pint, or even the quart, and share it
  with a friend. The best pure extracts contain no caramel and
  artificial color and little or no sugar.  Store extract at room
  temperature, tightly closed. It will keep up to five years.

      Title: ABOUT YEAST BREADS - BAKING TIPS
 Categories: Info, Crocker
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           See Below
 
  Use loaf pans of anodized aluminum, darkened metal glass for bread
  with well-browned crusts.
  
  Shiny cookie sheets or muffin cups produce sweet rolls u tender,
  golden brown crusts.
  
  Stagger loaf pans on a lower shelf of the oven so they do not touch
  sides of the oven or each other.
  
  The top of each pan should be level with, or slightly above, the
  middle of the oven.
  
  If baking round loaves on a cookie sheet, place the sheet on the
  center rack.
  
  Doneness is determined by tapping the crust. The loaf will have a
  hollow sound when done.
  
  Remove loaves from pans immediately and place on wire racks away from
  draft. to cool.
  
  For a shiny, soft crust, brush just-baked loaf with margarine, butter
  or shortening.
  
  STORING Bread and rolls can be stored in airtight containers in a
  cool dry place for 5 to 7 days. Refrigerate only in hot, humid
  weather. Breads can be stored, tightly wrapped in moistureproof or
  vaporproof material, labeled and dated, in the freezer for 2 to 3
  months. To thaw, let stand wrapped at room temperature for 2 to 3
  hours.

      Title: ABOUT YEAST BREADS - INGREDIENTS
 Categories: Crocker, Info
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        1 x  See Below
  
  Flour: All-purpose flour is the most widely used flour. It contains a
  special protein called gluten the structure builder of bread. When
  mixed with liquid and kneaded or beaten, the gluten stretches and
  gives elasticity to the dough by trapping bubbles of gas formed by
  the yeast. Some flours, such as rye and whole wheat, lack sufficient
  gluten and usually are used in combination with all-purpose flour.
  Self rising flour, which already contains leavening and salt, is not
  often recommended for yeast breads. However, all recipes were tested
  with self rising flour; adjustments are indicated when necessary.
  
  Yeast: Yeast is a live plant that gives off a gas that makes dough
  rise: It is very sensitive-too much heat will kill it, but cold will
  stunt its growth. Yeast is available in several forms: regular active
  dry yeast, quick-acting active dry yeast and compressed yeast. All of
  our recipes have been tested with dry yeast. Most of the recipes
  follow the traditional method of dissolving the yeast in warm water
  (105 to 115F). However, some recipes yield better results by mixing
  the yeast with the flour, then beating in very warm water (120 to
  130F).
  
  Liquids: Water or milk are the most commonly used liquids. Water gives
  bread a crisper crust; milk, a velvety texture and added nutrients.
  
  Sweeteners: Sugar, honey or molasses provide "food" for the yeast,
  enhance flavor and help brown the crust.
  
  Salt: A flavor agent that is needed to control the growth of the
  yeast and prevent overrising, which can cause the bread to collapse.
  
  Fat: Added to contribute to tenderness and flavor.
  
  Eggs: For flavor, richness and color, eggs are sometimes added.

      Title: ABOUT YEAST BREADS - YEAST DOUGHS
 Categories: Crocker, Info
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        1 x  See Below
  
  There are basically two kinds of yeast doughs-kneaded and batter. Both
  doughs need to rise before shaping and baking. To let dough rise,
  cover and keep in a warm, draft-free place. If necessary, place
  covered bowl of dough on wire rack over a bowl of warm water.
  
  Kneaded dough: Kneading develops the gluten and results in bread with
  an even texture and a smooth, nicely rounded top.
  
  After first addition of flour has been beaten in, dough will be very
  soft and will fall in "sheets" off rubber spatula.
  
  The second addition of flour makes the dough stiff enough to knead.
  Mix in only enough flour so dough leaves side of the bowl.
  
  To knead, fold dough toward you. With heels of hands, push dough away
  with short rocking motions. Give dough a quarter turn; repeat.
  
  When dough is properly kneaded, it will feel elastic and the top will
  be smooth with some blisters appearing on the surface.
  
  Dough should rise until double. Test by pressing fingertips 1/2 inch
  into dough. If impression remains, dough has risen enough.
  
  Punch down center of dough with your fist. Fold dough over and form
  into a ball. This releases large air bubbles to produce a finer
  texture.
  
  If dough is not sufficiently kneaded, the bread will be coarse, heavy,
  crumbly and dry.
  
  Batter dough: Batter breads are really shortcut no-knead yeast breads.
  Because less flour is used, the dough is stickier; instead of being
  kneaded, it is beaten with a mixer with the first addition of flour.
  The batter is generally not shaped but spread in the pan. The bread
  has a coarser texture and pebbled surface.
  
  REFRIGERATING YEAST DOUGH Yeast dough made with water (except. plain
  bread dough) can be refrigerated up to 5 days. However, if milk and
  at least 1/4 cup sugar are used, refrigerate no longer than 3 days.
  After mixing dough, grease top well. Cover with moistureproof wrap,
  then a damp cloth. Keep cloth damp during storage. When ready to
  bake, shape dough; let rise until double, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Bake as
  directed. Source: Betty Crocker's Cookbook, 6th Edition

      2 c  Oil
    3/4 c  Finely chopped pistachios *
    1/2 ts Ground cardamom
 
  *Note: Instead of pistachio nuts, walnuts may be used if desired.
  Dissolve sugar in water in heavy pan over medium heat. Bring to the
  boil, add lemon juice and saffron and boil for 10 minutes. Cool and
  strain into a 25 cm (10 inch) pie plate.  Keep aside. Break eggs into
  a casserole dish about 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter. The size and
  flat base are important. Add salt and mix eggs with fork until yolks
  and whites are thoroughly combined - do not beat as eggs must not be
  foamy. Heat oil in an electric frypan to 190 C (375 F) or in a 25 cm
  (10 inch) frypan placed on a thermostatically controlled hot plate or
  burner. Have ready nearby a long skewer, the plate of syrup, a baking
  sheet and the nuts mixed with the cardamom. A bowl of water and a
  cloth for drying hands are also necessary. Hold dish with eggs in one
  hand next to the pan of oil and slightly above it. Put hand into egg,
  palm down, so that egg covers back of hand. Lift out hand, curling
  fingers slightly inwards, then open out over hot oil, fingers
  pointing down.  Move hand across surface of oil so that egg falls in
  streams from fingertips.  Dip hand in egg again and make more strands
  across those already in pan.  Repeat 3 to 4 times until about an
  eighth of the egg is used.  There should be a closely meshed layer of
  egg strands about 20 cm (8 inches) across.  Work quickly so that the
  last lot of egg is added not long after the first lot. Rinse hands
  quickly and dry. Take skewer and slide under bubbling omelet, lift up
  and turn over to lightly brown other side. The first side will be
  bubbly, the underside somewhat smoother. When golden brown lift out
  with skewer and drain over pan. Place omelet flat in the syrup, spoon
  syrup over the top and lift out with skewer onto baking sheet. Roll
  up with bubbly side inwards. Finish roll should be about 3 cm (1 1/4
  inches) in diameter.  Put to one side and sprinkle with nuts. Repeat
  with remaining egg, making 7 to 8 rolls in all. Though depth of egg
  diminishes, you will become so adept that somehow you will get it in
  the pan in fine strands. When cool, cut kabaubs into 4-5 cm (1 1/2 to
  2 inch pieces and serve. These keep well in a sealed container in a
  cool place.

      Title: ABSOLUTELY APRICOT
 Categories: Abm, Fruits, Misc
      Yield: 1 Loaf
 
      3 ts Yeast; (active dry)
      3 c  Bread Flour
      2 tb Dry milk
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Apricot Jam
    3/4 c  Dried Apricots; chopped
  1 1/4 c  -Water
 
  If your machine offers the option, use the "light crust" setting as
  the crust browns more due to the sugar content of the jam. Try to use
  a jam with a high fruit content & few additives. This recipe can be
  baked on the regular, rapid bake, or timed settings. I have a DAK
  Turbo II & baked it on the reg setting.  It was one of the few loaves
  that have turned out really well lately...think my DAK is dying; just
  today ordered a ZOJI from Irwin. The bread kept VERY well in a
  Rubbermaid container...was nice & fresh for a whole week (I forgot
  about the last couple of slices!). I even made it when MY
  mother-in-law came to visit & she LOVED it! Hope it turns out good
  for you.

      Title: ABSOLUTELY DEEP DARK CHOCOLATE FUDGE BISCUITS
 Categories: Cookies, Chocolate, Low-fat/low
      Yield: 36 Servings
 
  7 1/2 oz All-purpose flour
      2 oz Cocoa Powder
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Salt
      8 oz Chocolate -- broken in 16
           Pcs
      4 oz Unsweetened Chocolate --
           Broken in 8 pcs
     12 oz Light Brown Sugar
      6 oz Unsalted Butter
      3    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla
  1 1/2 lb Chocolate Chips
 
  [Note: Instead of the unsweetened chocolate, I just used an extra
  4ozs of plain chocolate, and got perfect results. I think as long as
  you're using *really* good plain chocolate, say at least 55% cocoa
  solids, it doesn't really matter!]
  
  Preheat the oven to 325F / 170C / Gas 3.
  
  Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt.
  Set aside.
  
  Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium
  heat. Place the plain and the unsweetened chocolates in the top half
  of the double boiler. Tightly cover the top with cling film and allow
  to heat for 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir until
  smooth. Keep at room temperature until needed.
  
  Place the soft light brown sugar and butter in the bowl of an electric
  mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat on medium for 1 minute. Scrape down
  the bowl and beat on high for an additional 30 seconds. Scrape down
  the bowl. Add the eggs, one at a time, while beating on medium, and
  stopping to scrape down the bowl after incorporating each addition.
  Add the vanilla essence and beat on medium for 30 seconds. Add the
  melted chocolate and beat on low for 10 seconds more. Scrape down the
  bowl and beat for an additional 30 seconds. Add the sifted flour,
  cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt, and the chocolate chips,
  and beat on low until thoroughly combined - about 20 to 30 seconds.
  Remove the bowl from the mixer and mix thoroughly with a rubber
  spatula.
  
  Portion 6 to 8 biscuits per baking sheet by dropping 2 level
  tablespoons of batter per biscuit onto each of 2 non-stick baking
  sheets. Place the biscuits on the top and middle shelves of the
  preheated oven and bake for 18 to 22 minutes, rotating the sheets
  from top to bottom about halfway through the baking time. Allow the
  biscuits to cool for 5 to 6 minutes on the baking sheets. Transfer
  the biscuits to a cooling rack to thoroughly cool before storing in a
  sealed plastic container. Repeat this
  
  procedure until all the biscuits have been baked.
  
  Makes 3 to 3.  5 dozen biscuits

    1/2 c  Annotto seeds; crushed
      1    Chile, malagueta, dried
           -substitute piquin or
           -Japanese chile
      1    Bay leaves

MMMMM--------------------HEAT SCALE - MEDIUM-------------------------
 
    Combine all ingredients in a non-reactive heavy saucepan, allow to
  steep for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Bring mixture to a low
  and gentle boil while stirring continuously. Remove saucepan from
  heat and allow to cool thoroughly. Strain through a very fine sieve
  and pour the strained oil into a bottle and cap tightly. This oil
  will remain up to 6 months if it is refrigerated and capped tightly.
  This is a MEDIUM HOT condiment.
    This oil is used both to color and to flavor dishes. Use it in
  place of vegetable oil for South American recipes. Use only annatto
  (achiote) seeds that are bright-reddish in color; seeds that are
  brownish are old and have probably lost much of their flavor.

    1/2 c  Annatto seeds
 
    Heat the oil in a small saucepan, add the seeds and cook over low
  heat for about 5 minutes, stirring from time to time, until a rich
  orange color is obtained. Cool, strain and store in a covered jar in
  the refrigerator. It will keep for several months.
    If the seeds are cooked too long, the orange color will change to a
  golden color and much of the flavor is lost. Very stale seeds will
  give off all their color in one minute of cooking. Watch the saucepan
  carefully and remove it from the heat immediately the color begins to
  lighten.

      Title: ACORN SQUASH & WILD RICE
 Categories: Squash, Rice
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Acorn squash, ~1-1/2 lb ea
    1/2 lb Small Brussels sprouts
      2 ts Olive oil
      1 c  Diced onion
      1 ts Fennel seeds
      1 ts Dried marjoram
    1/4 c  Minced fresh sage
    1/4 c  Fresh orange juice
      2 ts Fresh lemon juice
    1/8 ts Freshly grated pepper
      2 c  Cooked wild rice
 
  1.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).
  
  2.  Cut each squash in half and remove the seeds and pulp. In a large
  baking dish, place the squash, cut side down, with about 1 inch of
  water. Bake until tender, about 45 minutes.
  
  3.  Pour about 2 inches of water into a large stockpot. Place a
  collapsible steamer in the pot, cover, and bring to a boil. Place the
  Brussels sprouts in the steamer, cover, and steam for 5 to 7 minutes,
  or until tender. Set aside.
  
  4.  Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat the oil over low heat. Add the
  onion and saute for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the
  fennel, marjoram, sage, orange juice, lemon juice, and pepper, and
  simmer for 3 minutes.  Stir in the cooked wild rice and the Brussels
  sprouts and heat through.
  
  5.  Spoon the wild rice and Brussels sprout mixture into the squash
  cavities.  Serve immediately.
  
  I often microwave the acorn squash by placing in a shallow glass pan
  with about 1/2-inch of water, covering with saran wrap and nuking for
  about 10 minutes or until tender.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Acorn squash
      1 ts Margarine
           Salt to taste
 
  NOTE:  Acorn squash seeds taste similar to pumpkin seeds except that
  the hulls on the squash seed are smaller. Therefore they are less dry
  tasting than pumpkin seeds and don't get caught in your throat as
  easily.
  
  Cut uncooked squash in half and scoop out seeds. Clean pulp and
  strings off the seeds in a collander under running water. Set the
  seeds on a towel to dry. Preheat oven to 350 deg. The seeds in a
  small bowl. Either melt margarine and pour onto seeds or put solid
  margarine into bowl and mix with you hands (my preferred method).
  Spread seeds evenly on a cookie sheet. Place in oven and cook 10 min.
  or until just starts to turn brown.

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
     12 oz Semi-sweet chocolate
    3/4 lb Sweet butter
      8    Egg yolks
      1 c  Brown sugar
    1/3 c  White sugar
    1/3 c  Ground almonds
      1 tb All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Cornmeal
      8    Egg whites
      1 tb Cream of tartar
 
  In a large saucepan over very low heat, melt chocolate. Add butter,
  stir until melted and remove from heat (the mixture should be body
  temperature, not too hot to touch with a finger). In a large bowl,
  combine egg yolks, brown and white sugar, and stir until well mixed.
  Add the chocolate, and stir well until combined. In a small bowl,
  combine almonds, flour and cornmeal, stir until well mixed. Pour this
  into the chocolate and stir until combined. In a large bowl with an
  electric mixer, beat the egg whites with cream of tartar until they
  form stiff peaks. Fold the egg whites into the chocolate in three
  batches.  Chef Dale Nichols warns that folding egg whites into
  chocolate takes a real knack and suggests using your hand as the
  paddle.  To do this by hand, use your hand as a paddle and push your
  palm down to the centre of the bowl, and slide up the side of the
  bowl and turn your hand over. Do not over-mix or you will knock the
  air out of the egg whites causing a much denser texture. Bake in a
  buttered, floured 10 inch spring form pan for 5 minutes at 400F.
  Reduce heat to 350F and bake for another 20 to 30 minutes, or until
  cake tests done in the centre. Let cool completely before removing
  from pan.

      Title: ADAI
 Categories: Vegetarian, Indian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Rice
    1/3 c  Urad dal
    1/3 c  Chana dal
    1/3 c  Yellow split peas
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Red chili powder
      1 lg Onion (opt)
      1    Carrot (opt)
    1/4 c  Coconut, grated (opt)
 
  Mix rice, chana dal, urad dal, and yellow split peas in a large
  vessel. Soak in a lot of water for about 2 hours.
  
  Grind the soaked mixture with chili powder and salt coarsely, without
  adding much water.
  
  Ferment for about 3 - 4 hours, then refrigerate or freeze. In cold
  weather, the fermenting process might take longer, and it might be a
  good idea to ferment in an oven (the pilot light will keep the
  mixture warm).
  
  Add either onions (finely cut), carrot (grated) or coconut before
  preparing.
  
  Freezing Notes
  
  If freezing, only ferment for about an hour.  The mixture will have
  to be left out for a while before being ready to use.

      Title: ADAI(SAVORY INDIAN PANCAKES)
 Categories: Digest, Indian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Mixture of dhals*
      2 c  Long grained rice
           Salt to taste.
 
  *(use any combination of tur dhal, chana dal or even split yellow
  peas)
  
  Wash and rinse the dhals and rice thoroughly. When the rinse water
  runs clear, soak the dhals and rice together in a bowl with fresh
  water for a couple of hours. Drain the dhal-rice mixture and grind
  into a somewhat coarse mixture in a blender using water when
  necessary. Empty the batter into a bowl, add some salt and let it
  rest for at least an hour. You could also let it ferment overnight if
  you like a sourdough tang in your pancakes.
  
  To make the pancakes, heat a non-stick/well-seasoned cast iron
  skillet on a moderate stove. If a few drops of water bounce off the
  pan, the pan is hot enough and you can proceed to make the pancakes.
  
  Drop a ladleful of the pre-prepared batter in the center of the pan
  and with the back of the ladle, swirl the batter from inside to
  outside to form a thin round pancake. Wait till the top looks dry,
  wait another minute if you like them crisp and flip to cook the other
  side. Remove onto a plate and eat immediately with a nice coriander
  chutney. (Continue preparing pancakes in the same way, till you run
  out of batter and/or chutney. The batter will also keep in the fridge
  for almost a week and you can prepare the pancakes when the mood
  strikes you.)
  
  Variation: Can add finely chopped onions/jalapenos/spinach/ginger/a
  few cumin seeds, anything you fancy, to the batter before making the
  pancakes. You will however not be able to make neat circular
  pancakes. Instead, you will end up with (tasty) irregular shaped ones.

  dressing ~ Blend cottage cheese or yogurt with milk for sour cream
  topping ~ Replace regular whipping cream with low-cal topping or
  yogurt ~ Remove visible fat from meat and skin from poultry before
  cooking ~ Decrease oil in marinades and salad dressing; increase
  vinegar, water and seasonings ~ Use foods canned in their own juice
  or water ~ De-fat meat drippings by refrigerating and skimming fat
  off the top ~ Decrease the amount of fat used in baked goods by 1/3
  to 1/2 and increase fluids called for to reach desired consistency. ~
  Cheese that is finely grated or thinly sliced goes further ~ Pour
  some of the fat off the top of "natural" peanut butters
  
  REDUCE SODIUM CONTENT ~ Use low-salt or no-salt-added products ~
  Increase your use of herbs and spices in place of salt in recipes ~
  Use fresh foods whenever possible in place of canned or processed
  (soup mixes, cured meats etc) or rinse canned foods (tuna) with water
  ~ Do not add salt to water when cooking pasta or other foods
  
  REDUCE SUGAR CONTENT ~ Decrease the amount of sugar called for in
  traditional recipes by at least 1/3; substitute fruit juices, nectars
  or pureed fruits. ~ Use fruit canned in water or fruit juice ~ Use
  non caloric sweeteners if needed to increase the sweetness of a
  recipe without added calories.  (Most baked desserts require at least
  3/4 tsp. sugar per serving to achieve a desirable flavor.)

MMMMM------------------ADAPTED BY LISA CRAWLEY-----------------------
      3 c  Bread Flour
      3 ts Fleischmann's Active Yeast
      1 c  Sour Dill Brine
    3/4 c  Water; warmed to 120 degrees
      2 tb Crisco
      2 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Dry Dill Weed
  1 1/2 c  Med. Rye Flour
  1 1/2 ts Caraway Seeds
      1    Lg. Egg; room temp.
 
  I used my crock dill brine and decreased the salt from the original
  recipe which called for 2 ts. due to the high salt content of my
  brine. I forgot the egg that is called for! I used 3 ts. Active Dry
  Yeast instead of the 3 pkg. called for in the conventional recipe. I
  warmed the brine and the water.

      Title: ADDICTIVE CREAM OF BROCCOLI SOUP
 Categories: Broccoli, Dairy, Cheese
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
  2 fresh broccoli (each about 3-in. bottom diameter) 1/2 lb butter 2
  to 6 cloves garlic, chopped 1 tb Chervil (fresh/dried chopped) 1 ts
  salt 1 ts white pepper 3 c milk (full-cream milk) 1 md egg yolk,
  beaten 1/4 c flour 1/8 ts cardamom 1/8 ts mace 1 c heavy cream
  (whipping) 1/3 c Gruyere cheese (fresh,
      grate fine) 1/3 c parmesan cheese (grate to
      powder)
  
  (1)  Cut broccoli into bite-size pieces.  Discard the hard stem
  pieces, but
     keep tender leaves and stem parts.
  
  (2)  Steam the cut broccoli for about 5-8 minutes, until just bright
  green
     in color.  Do not over- cook.
  
  (3)  In a 10-inch enameled (non-metal) skillet, heat 6 oz of butter
  until
     melted.  Add chopped garlic and wait until butter is hot enough to
     cook in. Add steamed broccoli, then chervil to the skillet. Lightly
     salt the broccoli.
  
  (4)  Cover, and cook over medium low heat, stirring occasionally with
  a
     wooden spoon, for another 5-10 minutes or until the broccoli turns
  a
     darker green color and becomes very soft.
  
  (5)  Mash the broccoli right in the skillet until no large pieces
  remain.
     Use a potato masher or a strong wooden spoon.  Mash until there
  are no
     pieces remaining that are too big to fit in a soup spoon.
  
  (6)  While broccoli is cooking, add beaten egg yolk to
        2    cups of milk.
  
  (7)  Put 3 Tbsp butter into a 2-3 quart saucepan.  Use enamel or
  glass for
     best soup flavor.  Metal pans will make this soup bitter. Melt
  butter
     and add flour.  When the flour bubbles and starts to cook, add the
     egg/milk mixture into the saucepan.  Add the cardamom, mace, and
  white
     pepper.  Stir con- tents of saucepan constantly with wooden spoon
     until thick. Lower the cooking heat.
  
  (8)  Empty the mashed broccoli mixture into the sau- cepan. Stir until
     well-mixed. Slowly stir in the remaining milk and the cream. As
  soon
     as the soup becomes hot enough to cook again, add the grated
  cheeses.
  
  (9)  Turn the heat down lower and simmer for about 5 more minutes,
  stirring
     to allow the cheeses to melt and mix while the table is being set.
     Serve immediately and retire quickly so as not to be trampled by
  those
     who smelled it cooking.
  
  NOTES This recipe may be doubled, halved or whatever without penalty.
  Vary
     the amount of milk added the second time to change the soup
  thickness
     to your own tastes.  You also may use any fresh green vegetable as
  a
     substitute for the broc- coli. Asparagus tips, artichoke hearts,
  and
     corn are espe- cially nice.  Cook them in the same way as you did
  the
     broc- coli.  Use any leftover butter on the hard French finger
  rolls.

      Title: ADOBE BREAD
 Categories: Bakery, Breads
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
      1 pk Active dry yeast (1/4 oz)
    1/4 c  Lukewarm water
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Vegetable shortening, melted
      1 c  Cold water
  4 1/2 c  All purpose flour
 
  In a large bowl, soften the yeast in the lukewarm water. Mix the
  salt, 2 tablespoons of the shortening, and the cold water together
  and add to the yeast mixture. Sift in the flour gradually, beating
  well after each addition for a smooth consistency.  You will probably
  have to knead in the final cup of flour. Shape the dough into a ball,
  brish lightly with the remaining shortening, and cover with a dry
  cloth.  Set the bowl in a warm place until doubled in bulk, anout 1
  hour. Punch the dough down and, on a floured board, knead about 5
  minutes. Shape into 2 round loaves on a well greased baking sheet.
  Cover with a dry cloth and set to rise another 45 minutes. Preheat
  the oven to 400F. Bake the loaves on a cookie sheet 50 minutes, until
  they are light brown and sound hollow when tapped.

      Title: ADOBO
 Categories: Mexican, Marinades
      Yield: 1 Cup
 
      8    Cloves of Garlic, unpeeled
      4    Dried chiles Anchos
           -stemmed,seeded,deveined
           -about 2 ounces
      6    Dried chiles Guajillos
           -stemmed,seeded,deveined
           -about 1 1/2 ounces
    1/2    Inch stick cinnamon
           -about 1/2 t ground
      1    Clove, or a pinch ground
     10    Black peppercorns
           -scant 1/4 t ground
      2 lg Bay Leaves broken up
    1/8 ts Cumin seed, or 1/8 t ground
    1/2 ts Dried Oregano
    1/2 ts Dried Thyme
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Cider vinegar
 
   Toasting the chiles and garlic. Roast the garlic cloves on a griddle
  or heavy skillet over medium heat, turning frequently, until
  blackened in spots and VERY soft, about 15 minutes. Remove, cool,
  skin and roughly chop.
   While the garlic is roasting, tear the chiles into flat pieces and
  toast them a few at a time: Use a metal spatula to press them firmly
  against the hot surface for a few seconds, until they blister,
  crackle and change color, then flip them over and press them flat to
  toast the other side.
   Soaking the dried chiles. Break the chiles into a small bowl, cover
  with boiling water, weight with a plate to keep submerged and soak 30
  minutes. Drain, tear into smaller pieces, place in a blender jar and
  add the garlic.
   Finishing the Adobo. In a mortar or spice grinder, pulverize the
  cinnamon, cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves and cumin. Add the chiles
  along with the oregano, thyme, salt, vinegar and 3 Tb water. With a
  long series of blender pulses, reduce the mixture to a paste. Run the
  blender for a few seconds until the mixture clogs, then scrape down
  the sides with a spatula and stir; repeat a dozen times or more until
  the mixture is smooth. Don't add water unless absolutely necessary or
  this marinating paste won't do its job well. Strain the paste through
  a medium-mesh sieve into a noncorrosive container with a
  tight-fitting lid. Cover and refrigerate.
   Considerations: After soaking the chiles, they can be put through a
  foley food mill to remove the skins and the seeds. Add this puree
  along with the garlic to the small blender jar and proceed. If this
  is done, and the mixture is put together in a small blender jar, and
  pulsed, scraped down, and mixed very well the final sieving can be
  eliminated.
   All of the chiles can be Ancho or Guajillo. You can substitute 3 1/2
  ounces of California or New Mexican chiles for the above chiles but
  the flavor will be light.
   Adobo with powdered chiles: For a darker, stronger tasting adobo made
  without the tedious series of blender runs, roast the chiles and
  garlic as directed above, then pulverize the chiles with the
  cinnamon,cloves,pepper, bay leaves and cumin in several batches in a
  spice grinder; sift through a medium-mesh sieve. Skin the garlic and
  mash it to a smooth paste. Mix with the powdered chile mixture,
  oregano, thyme, salt, vinegar and 6 Tb water. Store as directed above.

  This spicy marinade owes its unusual flavor to the chipotle, a smoked
  jalapeno chile.  Chipotles are usually sold canned in tomato paste.
  Look for them at Mexican and Latin American markets. Adobo marinade
  goes particularly well with pork.
  
  Juice the oranges and lime.  Finely chop chilies and garlic. Place
  citrus juices, chilies, garlic, oregano, cumin, black pepper, vinegar
  and salt in blender and puree until smooth.
  
  Makes enough marinade for 1 1/2 to 2 pounds meat or chicken.

  Place wings in large pan, layering is okay, but make sure that the
  pan is large enough to hold the wings and sauce. Pour sauce over the
  wings, and bake until wings are done and golden brown.  Stir
  occasionally. Typically, Adobo is done with a whole chicken, and
  simmered stove top and served with white rice.  It's fairly flexible,
  some folks will broil the chicken after simmering to crisp it up a
  little, and reduce the sauce a bit. Others will add a cup or two of
  water during the simmering process. Some add brown sugar for a little

      Title: ADOBONG PUSIT (SQUID WITH GARLIC & TOMATO)
 Categories: Ethnic, Seafood
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/2 kg Small fresh squids
    1/2 c  Native vinegar
     10    Cloves garlic
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1 md Onion, sliced
      2 md Tomatoes, chopped

      1 ts Vet-sin (monosodium
           -glutamate)
 
  Got down my single Filipino cook book and found this little gem. My
  grasp of Tagalog is non-existent but I'd guess that the name
  translates as "Squid Adobo". At any rate, it's squid stewed in
  vinegar. I assume that the reference to "native vinegar" refers to
  nipa sap vinegar (sukang paombong). The bottle I have is a milky
  looking vinegar that tastes pretty much like any vinegar so I imagine
  that you have some latitude on what type you can use.
  
  For those of you who have never tried it, Filipino food is an
  intriguing cuisine that has elements of Southeast Asian, Chinese and
  Mexican or Spanish influences. It has everything from spring rolls
  (lumpias) to rellenos dishes.
  
  Wash the squids very well.  Remove the long thin membrane in the head
  and slit the eyes to bring out the ink. Place the squids in a
  saucepan with vinegar, 6 cloves garlic crushed, salt and pepper.
  Cover and cook slowly until the squids are tender.  Cut cooked squids
  into 1/2 inch slices crosswise.
  
  Crush remaining garlic and saute in a little lard in another pan. Add
  the onion and tomatoes and cook until tomatoes are very soft. Add the
  squids and the liquid in which they were boiled. Simmer for 7
  minutes. Season with salt, pepper and vet-sin.

 Categories: Fish, German
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Pike, skinned & boned
  1 1/4 c  ;Water
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
      2    Eggs
      1 c  Butter, unsalted
           ;Salt & fresh ground pepper
      4    Eggs yolks

MMMMM------------------------WHITE SAUCE-----------------------------
      1 qt Chicken stock, hmmade or can
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
           ;Salt & fresh ground pepper
    1/2 c  Shredded Parmesan cheese
 
  Author's note: Adolph Frey owns one of the few Michelin-rated 2-star
  restaurants in Germany. He made this dish at the lodge for Carl's
  birthday celebration 1 year. Quenelles are poached fish-&-egg mounds
  traditionally made w/pike.
  
  To make quenelles, grind pike in food processor, or use a tamis if
  you have one. Set aside.
  
  Bring water to a boil. Sift in flour & stir until water is absorbed.
  Keep stirring so that mixture doesn't stick to pan. Remove from heat
  & beat in 1 egg. Cool mixture, then refrigerate until cold. Remove
  mixture from refrigerator & blend it in food processor until smooth.
  This is the panade.
  
  Cream butter in small bowl. Put ground pike in bowl that is set inside
  another bowl of ice. Season w/salt & pepper, mix in panade, &
  gradually add other whole egg & all egg yolks. When blended well, add
  butter. This can be done in food processor if all ingreds are kept
  cold. Chill mixture for 30 mins.
  
  To make white sauce, place chicken stock in heavy saucepan over medium
  heat. Bring to simmer, then reduce heat & continue to simmer on low
  until stock is reduced down to 1 cup liquid, abt. 45 mins.
  
  In large saucepan over med. heat, reduce cream until it begins to
  thicken, whisking occasionally.
  
  whisk thickened cream into stock, adding more or less cream,
  deepending on desired consistency. Season w/salt & pepper to taste.
  Strain sauce through a fine-mesh sieve, if desired. Makes 2 cups.
  
  To assemble dish, shape quenelles by mounding mixture between 2 warmed
  spoons. Set each quenelle on floured surface.
  
  Preheat oven to 400F. Butter baking dish large enough to hold
  quenelles. In wide saucepan, bring 3 qts water to a boil & poach
  quenelles for 15 mins w/o letting water boil. Drain thoroughly.
  arrange quenelles in prepared baking dish.
  
  Nap quenelles w/enough white sauce to cover. Sprinkle w/Parmesan.
  Bake for 15-20 mins, unti cheese browns. Serve 2-3 quenelles per
  diner.

      7 oz Light brown sugar
      9 tb Cocoa powder
     10 oz Butter or margarine;
           -softened
        pn Cinnamon
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 lb Plain flour (approximately)
 
  Preheat the oven to 400F.  Mix all of the ingredients together,
  except for the flour.  Add the flour slowly to the rest of the
  mixture until it reaches the right consistency to roll out. The dough
  should be quite soft. (You may find it easier to knead it with your
  hands.) Roll out on a floured surface to a thickness of about 1/4
  inch and cut into decorative shapes with small cookie cutters, a
  sharp knife or the rim of a glass. Place on a greased baking sheet
  and bake in the oven for about 8 minutes. Remove from the oven while
  they are still soft and cool on a rack, then pack into crocks or jars.
  
  The authors note that the Pennsylvania Dutch settlers made these at
  Thanksgiving and stored them in a stoneware crock until Christmas. The
  cookies can be made at any time, but allowed to age for 4-6 weeks.
  They can be used as a substitute for graham crackers for a pie crust.

 Categories: Ethnic, Beverages, Alcohol
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
     10    Eggs
    1/2    Level teaspoon salt
    275 g  Sugar
      4 dl Cognac
      1    1/2 level teaspoons vanilla
           -essence (extract, I think)
 
  Separate the eggs and beat the yolks with the salt and the sugar,
  until the mixture is thick and creamy. Beat in the cognac, very
  slowly and put the mixture into a double saucepan. Heat gently,
  whisking all the time until the advocaat is warm (not hot) and thick.
  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla essence. Pour
  into a jug. Advocaat is served in a glass and eaten with a teaspoon.
  It can also be topped with whipped cream.
  
  Also, might I add, that advocaat is nothing like the eggnog here in
  America...it is thick and creamy---not foamy at all. Boy, is Advocaat
  delicious!
  
  (I usually get a bottle of it from the Dutch-America store and skip
  the above...:)
  
  This delicious Dutch drink is actually eaten with a spoon!

      Title: ADVOKAAT
 Categories: Drinks, Alcohol
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Vanilla sugar
      2 c  Milk
      9    Egg yolks
  1 1/2 c  Grain alcohol
           -(95-percent)
 
  Mix sugars.  Boil milk with half of sugars for two minutes. Let it
  cool down. (For the milk it is easiest to use a pot which can later
  be used with a mixer.)
  
  Mix well (mixer at high speed) the yolks with the other half of the
  sugars. Using mixer add to milk. Then (still using mixer) add alcohol
  slowly. (The result is quite fluid, sweet and strong.)  Bottle and
  let rest for two weeks to let the mixture thicken.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Egg-cognac:  a potent sweet alcoholic beverage -- Advokaat is the
  Dutch word for egg cognac.  It is highly recommended for A. I.
  (Alcohol Imbibing) meetings. This recipe is my modification of a
  recipe I obtained in Poland. It makes a potent, superb advokaat (or
  egg-cognac). The milk and eggs are healthy, the sugar and alcohol are
  not. Yield: Serves 4-8.
  
  *  This advokaat can be drunk or, better yet, eaten with a spoon; it
  is quite thick.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 2 weeks aging.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients.

      Title: AEBLESKIVER NO APPLES
 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Milk
      3    Eggs, separated
      2 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
      4 ts Baking power
      1 tb Sugar
           Vegetable oil
 
  Combine milk and egg yolks.  Sift together dry ingredients and add to
  milk/egg mixutre.  Beat egg whites until stiff and fold into mixture.
  Heat aebleskiver pan and put about 1 tsp oil in each cup of the pan.
  when very hot, pour enough batter in each cup to almost fill it. Use
  knitting needle (or any pointed tool) to turn aebleskivers. Keep
  turning them until golden brown.  Add shortening as needed for each
  new batch. Makes about 3 dozen.
  
  This recipe was a huge hit at my summer beach house -- we had it every
  Saturday!  We top them with powdered sugar, fresh berries, and whipped
  cream.
  
  Good luck finding the pans -- mine was a gift.  I later found one
  more at a discount cooking store at the shore. However, this year I
  searched the shore and the Washington area and have yet to find
  another. The store managers of the discount places say they never
  know what they are going to get.   Since my first one came from some
  catalogue (they don't even sell them anymore!) you might try calling
  a very high end cookware store and seeing if they can order you one.
  The pans are cast-iron, so you'd need a distributor of cast-iron
  cookware. (Hmm -- you could also check the manufacturer of whatever
  is in the stores and call the company directly.) Let me know if you
  have any success.
  
  By the way -- I started making these because my husband is Dutch, and
  Holland considers aebleskivers ~- which they call "Poffritches" -- a
  great delicacy!

      2 c  Buttermilk
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Flour
      1 tb Baking powder

  Beat egg whites until stiff.
  
  Mix egg yolk-buttermilk mixture with dry ingredients. Add egg whites,
  carefully folding them in so that they don't break down.
  
  Heat aebleskive pan. Put 1 tsp salad oil in each hole and fill
  completely with batter. Let bake until slightly crusty on bottom.
  Turn slightly with a knitting needle or skewer. Continue cooking,
  turning the ball to keep it from burning, until the knitting needle
  comes out clean when stuck in the center.
  
  Serve aebleskive hot with powdered sugar, jam, and jelly.
  
  Notes included with recipe: For those of you who are unfamiliar with
  aebleskive, it is a baked delight made with a pancake-like batter,
  cooked in a special pan that turns the aebleskive into a crusty ball,
  and is known as the "Danish Doughnut." As you can tell, it is a
  little difficult to give aebleskive an easy definition other than to
  tell you that it is good enough to go ahead and order the pans if you
  are likely to serve breakfasts and brunches to family and friends.
  
  Aebleskive pans are available through most gourmet cookware shops or
  can be ordered from Pea Soup Andersen's Santa Ynez Valley Wine Center,

 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      2 lg Cloves garlic
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Plain, whole-milk yogurt
           Juice and pulp of 1 large
           -lemon, 3 to 4 tablespoons
    1/2 ts Cracked black pepper
      2 lg Whole chicken breasts, about
           -2 pounds
 
  Long, slow marinating in garlicky yogurt tenderizes, moistens and
  adds deep flavor, so you end up with skinless grilled chicken that's
  as delicious as it is nutritionally correct. Serve with soft pita or
  Arab flatbread and fresh yogurt.
  
  Put the salt in a wide, shallow non-reactive bowl with the garlic and
  mash them together until you have paste. Add yogurt, lemon and pepper.
  
  Skin the chicken breasts, remove all visible fat and separate the
  halves. Bend each backward to break the bones so the pieces win lie
  flat. Add to the yogurt and turn so all surfaces are well-coated.
  
  Cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate. Allow to marinate at least
  overnight, up to a day and a half. Turn when you think of it.
  
  To cook, remove breasts from marinade and wipe off all but a thin
  film. Broil or grill about 6 inches from the heat for 6 to 8 minutes
  a side, or until thoroughly cooked. Meat will brown somewhat but
  should not char. Serve at once.

    1/2 lb Dry red chiles
    1/2 lb Coriander seeds
      2 oz Cumin
      1 oz Turmeric
      1 oz Mustard seeds
 
  Curry powders are an important part of African cooking due to the
  heavy influence of Arabic and Indian cuisine in Africa. Curry powders
  are made from different proportions of spices, dried and ground.
  Spices can be dried in the sun for two to three days, in a low
  temperature oven, or on top of the stove in a dry skillet. If using a
  skillet be sure to shake the spices constantly so they don't burn.
  Grinding is usually done with a mortar and pestle.  Curry powders are
  not necessarily hot, they are made that way by the addition of chili
  peppers.
  
  Dry spices, grind to a powder and seal in an airtight container. Use 2
  teaspoons of curry powder to every

      1    Onion (very large),
           -chopped
      1    Swiss chard bunch
      1 cn Garbanzo beans
           -(known also as chick
           -peas, ceci, etc.)
    1/2 c  Raisins
    1/2 c  Rice, raw
      2    Yams
           Several fresh tomatoes
           -(or large can)
      1    Garlic clove

           Salt and pepper,
           -to taste

  Fry onion, garlic and white stems of chard until barely limp. Add
  chopped greens and fry a bit.
  
  Either peel the yams or scrub them well with a vegetable brush, then
  slice them into thick slices. Add garbanzos, raisins, yams, tomatoes,
  salt and pepper.  Cook a couple of minutes.
  
  Make a well in the center of the mixture in the pot. Put the rice in
  the well and pat it down until it's wet. Cover and cook until rice is
  done, about 25 minutes. Add Tabasco sauce to taste.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A spicy vegetable stew -- I got this recipe from my mom, who got
  it from a friend. It's very easy to make.
  
  *  I find that the flavors of the vegetables don't stand out unless
  you put in a lot of tabasco. But then, I've got a cast-iron tongue.
  You should add enough to make the stew seem spicy to you.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      3 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Hot water
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      3 tb Unsalted butter, melted
    1/3 c  Shredded coconut
      1 lg Egg
    1/2 c  Sour cream
           Glaze:
      1 tb Unsalted butter
      1 c  Sifted confectioner's sugar
      2 tb Water
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  The light and moist cupcakes have a delicate cinnamon-scented
  chocolate glaze that's spread over them while they are still warm.
  
  1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375
  degrees F. Line twelve 2 1/2-inch muffin cups with paper liners.
  
  2. Place cocoa in a small bowl and stir in 1/2 cup very hot tap water
  to dissolve.
  
  3. In a large bowl combine the melted butter and sugar; beat with an
  electric mixer until blended. Add the egg and beat until light, 1 to 2
  minutes. Add the cocoa mixture and beat until smooth. In a small bowl
  stir together the sour cream and baking soda. Stir this mixture into
  the butter-sugar mixture. Add the flour and vanilla; beat quickly,
  just until evenly blended. With a spoon stir in the coconut.
  
  Spoon the batter into the muffin cups, dividing it evenly among them;
  they will be about three-quarters full. Bake about 20 minutes, until
  the tops spring back when lightly touched and a toothpick inserted in
  the center comes out clean. Remove the tea cakes from the pan and
  cool slightly on a rack while you prepare the glaze.
  
  4. Spread about 2 teaspoons of the chocolate glaze on each of the
  warm tea cakes and let cool thoroughly.
  
  Chocolate Glaze:
  
  Makes 1/2 cup
  
  Drizzle this simple and tasty glaze over the afternoon tea cakes or
  over any cake that's been frosted with seven-minute caramel frosting.
  
  1. In a small saucepan combine the butter with 2 tablespoons water.
  Place over low heat, add the chocolate, and stir until the chocolate
  melts and the mixture thickens slightly; remove from the heat.
  
  2. In a small bowl combine the confectioner's sugar and cinnamon;
  stir in the chocolate mixture and the vanilla to make a smooth glaze.

  The tangy tingling sensation it causes after being splashed on is one
  way to describe an aftershave. Most aftershaves act as astringents;
  they help firm skin tone and close skin pores when applied
  immediately after shaving. Many aftershaves contain alcohol, which
  possesses antibacterial abilities, helping to prevent infections of
  knicks or shaving cuts. It also should contain glycerine and/or other
  ingredients known to be beneficial to skin care. Glycerine will help
  counter the drying effects on the skin, and the chafing and
  irritation that can develop with dry skin. *Most drug stores contain
  all of the above tinctures and oils. Herb and health food shops carry
  the essential oils.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  Unbleached white flour
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
     12 tb (1 1/2 sticks) cold, sweet
           -butter
      2 c  Raisins
      1    Egg
    1/2 c  Honey
      1 c  Buttermilk
 
  Makes 1 large loaf.
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.
  
  Sift the flour, baking powder, soda and salt into a large mixing
  bowl. Cut the butter into small pieces and add. Cut it into the flour
  with a pastry blender until the mixture is the size of peas. Add the
  raisins and toss to distribute evenly, using two forks.
  
  Beat the egg in another bowl until very frothy.  Beat in the honey.
  When it is well blended, beat in the buttermilk.
  
  Gradually pour the liquids into the flour, tossing all the while with
  a fork so the mixture gets evenly moistened. Continue tossing lightly
  with two forks until the batter comes together; it doesn't have to be
  completely mixed and should be very rough and lumpy.
  
  Butter a heavy skillet or casserole, 10 to 11 inches in diameter and
  2 to 3 inches deep.  Round is the traditional shape. Spoon batter out
  into the pan and push it gently to fill the pan. It can mound up
  somewhat in the middle. Bake at 350 F about an hour or until the
  middle is set. Cut out a piece to test if necessary.
  
  Cut into wedges and serve warm from the pan.

 Categories: Greek, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  The classic Greek sauce, avgolemono, is a great low-fat alternative
  to the melted butter, mayonnaise or vinaigrette dipping sauces
  usually served with artichokes.
  
  Snap the stems off four large artichokes and trim the bases so that
  they will sit upright on a plate.  Boil a potful of water to which
  you have added the juice of a lemon and a pinch of salt. Drop the
  artichokes in and boil for 30 minutes or until they are tender. Test
  by pulling off an outer leaf and trying the flesh at the base for
  tenderness.
  
  Meanwhile, in another saucepan, bring a cup of chicken stock to the
  boil. In a cup, mix about two-thirds of a tablespoon of cornflour
  with a little water until it is smooth and add to the boiling stock,
  stirring until it thickens.
  
  Separate 3 eggs, beat the whites until they hold stiff peaks, then
  add the yolks and continue beating tin the whole mass is fluffy.
  Still beating, add the juice of a lemon and pour in the boiling
  stock. Pour this mixture back into the stock saucepan, and stir it
  over a low heat for a couple of minutes.  It must not boil.
  
  Place the artichokes in the centre of warmed plates and pour the
  avgolemono over them.  Serve.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

  1. Prepare the pasta.  Place dry ingredients and butter in food
  processor fitted with a pastry blade and run machine for 1 minute, or
  until butter is cut up and mixture feels sandy.  Add eggs and run
  machine in quick spurts for 2 minutes, or until dough forms a compact
  ball. 2. Cut dough into 4-5 small pieces.  Lightly flour each and
  roll it through pasta machine (set rollers at widest gap). When dough
  is smooth, reduce gap between rollers and roll the dough again.
  Continue in this fashion until rollers are at their narrowest
  setting.  As dough sheets come out, dust them lightly with flour and
  spread them out on the table. 3. Prepare filling. Steam spinach for
  30 seconds or until tender, rinse it under cold water, and squeeze it
  tightly to extract all the water. Place the spinach and remaining
  ingredients for filling in food processor and grind until smooth.

      4 qt Chicken broth

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      8 tb Unsalted butter
    1/2 lb Mascarpone
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
           Salt & black pepper to taste
      1 pn Freshly grated nutmeg

MMMMM--------------------------TO SERVE-------------------------------
      8 tb Parmesan cheese; grated
 
  Cut the prosciutto and pancetta into small pieces and remove the
  casing from the sausages. Using a meat grinder, grind together the
  prosciutto, pancetta, and sausages. Place the ground meat in a
  crockery or glass bowl, add the butter and eggs, and mix very well
  with a wooden spoon until the butter is completely incorporated. Add
  the bread crumbs and Parmesan, and season with salt and pepper. Cover
  the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before using.
  
  When ready, bring the broth to a boil in a large pot over medium heat.
  Meanwhile, place a large skillet with the butter over low heat. When
  the broth reaches a boil, start shaping the meat mixture into tiny
  meat balls; a heaping tablespoon of mixture will be enough to prepare
  several. Make sure the meat balls are solid with no holes inside.
  Drop the balls into the boiling broth a few at a time, and as they
  rise to the top, tansfer them with a slotted spoon to the skillet
  containing the butter. When all the meat balls are cooked and in the
  skillet, add the mascarpone and heavy cream. Mix very well and simmer
  for 1 or 2 minutes, or until the mascarpone is completely dissolved.
  Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Mix very well, then transfer to
  a warmed serving platter. Serve immediately, with some Parmesan on
  the side.

      3 c  Brown sugar
      3 c  Margarine
      6 c  Oatmeal
      3 c  Flour
      1 tb Baking soda
      2 c  Chocolate chips
 
  Put the ingredients in large bowl. Mash, squeeze, knead, etc until it
  is completely blended. Form into small balls about 1 to 1 1/2 inches
  in size. Place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Butter the bottom of a
  small glass and dip into white sugar, then pound the cookies flat.
  Bake at 350 degrees for about 10 to 12 minutes. This is a good recipe
  to use when you need to get rid of some agressions because the dough
  is too heavy for most mixers. So you have to use your hands and beat
  it!! You can also use peanut butter or butterscotch chips or a
  mixture of them.

  According to NBC sportscaster Ahmad Rashad, men and women behave very
  differently in the kitchen. "When men cook, it usually looks like a
  disaster area," says the former Minnesota Viking. "And there's no
  rhyme or reason to what they make. My father sometimes cooked chicken
  for breakfast. And when he cooked, everything came out six times
  bigger than when Mom cooked."
  
  Rashad's father prepared banana pancakes for him when he was a little
  boy, back in Tacoma, Washington. Washad, in turn, makes them for his
  5-year-old daughter, Condola Phylea. On Super Bowl Sunday, he
  promises, she'll be starting off her day with a short stack.
  
  1. In a mixing bowl, using a hand or electric mixer, beat eggs for 2
  minutes until frothy. Add flour, baking powder, milk and oil. Stir in
  bananas.
  
  2. On a hot griddle, pour 1/4 cup batter for each pancake. Cook until
  edges become dry, about 2 minues per side. Top with banana slices.
  Drizzle with honey or maple syrup and sprinkle with pecans.

      Title: AIGO BOUIDO (GARLIC SOUP)
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Separated head or about 16
           -cloves whole, unpeeled
           -garlic
      2 qt Water
      1 ts Salt
      1 pn Of pepper
      2    Cloves
    1/4 ts Sage
    1/4 ts Thyme
    1/2    Bay leav
      4    Sprigs parsley
      3 tb Olive oil
 
  This isn't cream of garlic soup, but it has a creamy texture. I've
  done this one and it's great.  As Julia says, "Because the garlic is
  boiled, its after-effects are at a minimum, and its flavor becomes
  exquisite, aromatic and almot undefinable."
  
  From Julia Child's "Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. I":
  
  Drop garlic cloves in boiling water and boil for 30 seconds. Drain,
  run cold water over them and peel. Place the garlic and the rest of
  the ingredients in a 3-quart saucepan and boil slowly for 30 minutes.
  Correct seasoning.
  
  3 egg yolks 3 to 4 T. olive oil
  
  Beat the egg yolks with a wire whip in a soup tureen for a minute or
  until they are thick and sticky.  Drop by drop beat in the olive oil
  for making a mayonnaise.
  
  Rounds of hard-toasted French bread 1 cup of grated Swiss or Parmesan
  cheese
  
  Just before serving, beat a ladleful of hot soup into the egg mixture
  by droplets.  Gradually strain in the rest, beating and pressing the
  juice out of the garlic. Serve immediately, accompanied by the bread
  and cheese.

      Title: AIKEN COUNTY CORN BREAD DRESSING
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  White corn meal
      1 c  Flour
      2 c  Milk
      2 tb Shortening
      2 tb Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
      1    Onion
      2    Eggs
 
  Pepper to taste
  
  Make a batter of the cornmeal, flour, salt, baking powder, shortening
  (the oil from the baking fowl is generally used) and milk. Bake in a
  hot oven (400) until done, about half an hour. Then crumble the
  bread, add one medium sized onion, chopped fine, pepper and a little
  more salt. Break in the two eggs and wet with the juice from the
  baking chicken or turkey. The liver chopped fine and added to the
  dressing improves it, as does the addition of hard cooked egg. After
  mixing thoroughly, put the mixture on one side of the baking dish and
  roast with the fowl until brown. When basting the fowl, baste the
  dressing also to keep it moist and to improve the flavor. This amount
  will serve 12 persons.

      Title: AIOLI
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      6    Cloves of garlic, peeled
    1/2 c  Pine nuts
      3    Potatoes, boiled, peeled and
      1    Juice of a lemon
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
 
     Combine the garlic and nuts in a blender or food processor and
  puree. Add the potatoes, and puree. Pour potato mixture into a bowl
  and, using a whisk, beat in the lemon juice, a bit at a time.
  Gradually add the olive oil in a thin stream while continuing to beat
  so oil combines with potato mixture. When oil has been absorbed, add
  the egg and beat well. Giovanni de Bourbon-Sicily, French Vogue Note:
  If you omit the raw egg, you still get a nice sauce. According to an
  ancient proverb, "Garlic is as good as 10 mothers." If the latest flu
  bug has hit your house--and whose has escaped--you may be ready to
  test claims for garlic's medicinal powers.
     Since 1983, the National Library of Medicine has gathered 125
  scientific papers on the therapeutic potential of garlic. They've
  found some interesting material. It's clear that allicin, the smelly
  compound in garlic, is an antibiotic--but only if taken raw. Heat
  destroys the elements that have antibiotic properties. Raw or cooked,
  garlic can also work as a decongestant and expectorant for common
  colds and bronchitis. Regularly eating raw garlic seems to act as a
  deterrent for these ailments, according to Dr Irwin Ziment. A Dr
  Abdullah, who eats a couple of raw garlic cloves a day, claims he has
  not had a cold since 1973. Admittedly, eating raw garlic won't help
  your social life but Kyolic, a deodorized garlic compound from Japan,
  may allow you to have good health and good friends. I've also heard
  of fresh garlic imported from Japan that supposedly is deodorized. If
  any of you have found it in local stores, let us know. It would be
  interesting to hear if it lives up to the claims made for it.
     Since having the flu is no fun, this may be a good time to take
  your chances and share some pungent garlic dishes with friends and
  family--for health's sake. It's easy to add minced fresh garlic to
  hummus or tabbouleh, Mid-Eastern dishes you can buy in many deli's
  and natural food stores. If you're brave, you can try my
  grandmother's cold cure. Spread a slice of black bread with butter,
  then layer thin slivers of raw garlic all over the bread. Eat this
  and it'll cure what ails you...or keep everyone so far away that no
  germs will reach you! Aioli is a milder way to enjoy raw garlic. This
  French condiment, a sort of mayonnaise, is a puree of garlic, boiled
  potatoes, olive oil and egg. Serve it with chicken, grilled fish,
  dolloped into soup and on vegetables.

      5    Garlic cloves
      1    Egg, at room temperature
      1 c  Olive oil, at room temp.

  Crush the garlic in a food blender. Add the egg, and blend for 15

  that an emulsion can take place. Stir in the lemon juice by hand.
  Hint: To get the smell of garlic off your hands, simply rub your
  hands in used coffee grinds. End of odor. In Italy, it is common to
  eat a whole coffee bean after a big meal so that your lover will not
  be bothered by garlic.

      1 c  Baking soda
    1/4 c  Ammonia
      1 tb SCENT OF YOUR CHOICE:
           -perfume, lemon extract or
           -juice, VANILLA BEAN EXTRACT
           -or pine oil
     16 c  Water
 
  ** For a quick fix for a stubborn odor, here's a traditional solution
  that you can customize to your taste.
  
  Into a clean gallon size plastic jug pour baking soda, ammonia, and
  the scent of your choice. Slowly fill with warm water. Label and cap
  jug. Keep out of the reach of children. Pour small quantities of the
  solution into pretty containers with spray tops--old perfune
  containers or atomizers are ideal. Then you can leave the refresher
  on the counter in rooms where you need it frequently.
  
  To Use: Simply mist the air where unpleasant odors abound. Avoid
  spraying on or near furniture or pets. Wipe up any reside if you
  overdo, but the mist will not harm anything if you don't soak an item
  with the mist. Especially AVOID spraying directly on FINE WOOD
  FURNITURE--The ammonia, scent, or water could harm the finish. 1 gal.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Broiler chicken
      1 c  Kecap (or ketjap) manis*
      2    Garlic cloves
           -- peeled and mashed
      2 tb Fresh lime juice
    1/2 c  Melted, unsalted butter
    1/2 ts Grated fresh ginger
      1 ts Sambal oelek**
      1 pk Kroepoek oedang***
           Cornstarch to thicken
           -- marinade for sauce
 
  *Sweet soy sauce.
  
  **Hot pepper sauce.
  
  ***Shrimp puffs.
  
  Note:  Ingredients from Indonesia are available at many Dutch,
  Chinese, Vietnamese and Indonesian specialty stores. This...dish is
  good with Nasi Goreng (fried rice).
  
  Cut chicken into 8 pieces.  Combine remaining ingredients, except
  shrimp puffs, in large bowl.  Add chicken pieces; toss to coat.
  Marinate 2 hours at room temperature, stirring occasionally. Remove
  chicken pieces from marinade (reserving some of the marinade for
  basting and the rest for sauce).
  
  Roast, uncovered, at 400 F. for 35 to 40 minutes or until done,
  basting as needed.  If browning too quickly, cover with foil. (In
  summer, barbecue over charcoal fire.)
  
  Heat reserved marinade with cornstarch until thickened and serve as
  sauce, if desired.  Serve with shrimp puffs on the side. For these,
  simply deep-fry in hot fat or oil (375 F. on fat thermometer),
  draining at once on paper towels.  The chips will puff up as soon as
  they hit the fat.
  
  Yield: 4 servings on its own, 6 as part of an Indonesian rice table.

      Title: AJIACO
 Categories: Ethnic, Soups/stews, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter
      1 ts Cayenne pepper
      1 c  Unsalted chicken stock
      4    Ears yellow corn, shucked,
           Sliced into 1-inch thick
           Wheels
      3 lb Chicken, cut into bite size
           Pieces.
      2 ts Sweet paprika
      1 c  Onions finely diced
      3 c  Milk
      2 lg Yucca peeled and cut into
           Inch thick dice.
           Juice of one lime.
 
  This recipe is for a Cuban stew/soup that I used to enjoy con mucho
  gusto. This version of Ajiaco was prepared by Senora Garcia in her
  little store front restaurant on Collins Ave. in Miami Beach.
  Although this is not her exact recipe, it's the closest I could get
  to it. Ajico del Restaurant Garcia ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Melt
  the butter in a 6 qt. pot over medium heat.  Cook chicken pieces in
  the butter until no longer pink. Remove chicken with slotted spoon
  and place in in a bowl. Put onion, garlic, cayenne, and paprika in
  pot and cook while stirring, until onion is translucent and colored
  with the paprika. Add stock, milk, yuca, corn, and chicken to the
  pot. Bring almost to a boil then reduce heat, cover and simmer,
  stirring every now and then, for about 1 hour, or until yucca is
  tender.  Remove from heat and stir in lime juice. Serve with Cuban or
  French bread that has been sliced and broiled until golden.
  
  As an alternative frozen corn on the cob will work, as well as fresh
  frozen kernels.  The fresh corn cob seems to impart a nice flavor to
  this dish.
  
  If you're wondering what to do with the wheels of corn, just pick 'em
  up with your fingers and nibble 'round the rims.
  
  This dish recieved rave reviews at the 1991 Blind Pass Marina Xmas
  Party.

    1/2 c  Aka miso (red soybean paste)
           Aji-no-moto (msg)
 
    Place the ichiban dashi in a 2 quart saucepan and set a sieve over
  the pan. With the back of a large spoon, rub the miso through the
  sieve, moistening it from time to time with some of the dashi to help
  force it through more easily.
    Bring the soup to a simmer over moderate heat. Then remove from the
  heat and stir in a small pinch of MSG.
    Pour the soup into bowls, add misoshiru no-me (miso soup garnish -
  see recipes) and serve at once. If the soup seems to be seperating,
  stir to recombine it.
    Miso soups are sweeter than other Japanese soups and usually are
  served toward the end of a formal Japanese meal.

  instructions below about boiling crab meat and alter technique if
  using pre-cooked crab meat, perhaps by just boiling some ginger and
  cloves in small amount of water and adding a bit to flavor crab. --

  Put crab meat in boiling salted water along with ginger piece and
  cloves. Cook about 15 minutes, until meat is tender enough to flake
  with a fork. Drain, flake and set aside.
  
  In a heavy pot, heat oil to a moderate temperature and add other
  ingredients in the following sequence, stirring for a minute or so
  between each: onions, ground ginger, tomatoes, tomato paste, green
  pepper, paprika, cayenne, and dried shrimp.  Reduce heat and simmer
  for 4-5 minutes, stirring constantly, until vegetables are cooked.
  Add crab meat and stir another couple of minutes to heat it through.
  Then spoon the mixture into clean crab shells or ramekins (small
  individual baking dishes).
  
  Sprinkle bread crumbs on top of each crab and toast under an oven
  broiler, being careful not to let the crumbs scorch. Garnish with egg

      Title: AKPITH (CORN/MAIZE & BEAN FLOUR SNACK)
 Categories: Snacks, Breads, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Corn/maize meal
    1/2 c  Soy flour
  1 1/2 tb Baking powder
    1/2 ts Chili powder (optional)
           Sugar to taste
      1 c  Water
           Oil
           Salt and pepper
 
  Corn/maize was introduced to Africa from Latin America by the
  Portuguese, mainly to provision their slave ships. The grain was
  quickly accepted because it grew rapidly and undemanding in
  cultivation. The name 'maize' comes from 'mahiz', the word used by
  the Caribbean Taino Indians from whom the Europeans probably first
  learned about the crop. in North American the English settlers were
  shown it by local Indians. 'Corn' was a general name given to any
  grain, so they called it simply 'Indian corn'.
  
  Columbus noted that maize was "most tasty boiled, roasted or ground
  into flour".  And in southern Ghana today a common food is 'kenkey',
  fermented corn/maize flour balls, wrapped in corn/maize leaves and
  steamed. Akpith, this recipe, is more straightforward.
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== In a large saucepan, boil the water and then
  in half of the corn/maize meal and all the soy flour to make a thick
  porridge. Add the baking powder, chili powder if using and sugar;
  season.
  
  Cook this for 10 minutes over a low heat, stirring constantly. Then
  remove the pan and set aside to cool for 10 minutes or so.
  
  At this point, mix in the remaining corn/maize meal and combine
  thoroughly, adding water to produce a stiff dough.
  
  Now pour enough oil into a pan or wok to give a depth of around 2
  inches (5 cms), and heat up.  While it is warming mould the dough
  into balls about 1 inch (2.5 cms) in diameter.
  
  With the oil sizzling hot, slide 4 or 5 balls carefully into the pan
  and cook for 2-3 minutes until they are golden brown.

      Title: AL'S CHICKEN SCHNITZEL
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      1 kg Chicken Breasts
      4 lg Eggs
      2 c  Flour
      2 c  Bread Crumbs(Krummies etc)
 
  All MEASUREMENTS and CURRENCY mentioned below in in METRIC and
  Australian currency. In 1 kg you usually get 3 breasts so cut them in
  half as described below and 2 halfs usually make a filling meal.Costs
  about $10 to serve a family since adult can have 2 halfs with mashed
  potato and mini carrots etc and children can have 1. This is my first
  Recipe so here goes.
  
  Cut Chicken Breasts down the middle into 2 parts. Use Spiked Mallet
  to beat chicken till its a mit thinner so it cooks better.Also trim
  any skin or get skinless breasts to reduce amount of calories.
  
  Get 3 plates.On the first plate sift flour on to plate. On second
  plate,beat eggs and pour onto a deep plate. On third put the bread
  crumbs on it.
  
  Dip or cover breasts in flour.Shake off excess.Coat breast with egg
  either by brushing on or dipping on plate.Then cover in bread crumbs
  and put on plate.
  
  On this is done you are ready to cook them.Now I usually cook mine so
  that the bread crumbs brown but dont get burnt so the schnitzel is
  very soft.Since I'm not an experienced cook but have to do the
  cooking for the family (Im 15) I dont know if Im undercooking them or
  what but they taste best that way.Just cook them and when the look
  cooked cut in half and if the meat is white(like chicken sould look
  not the colour of an uncooked fillet) they are cooked.I cook on
  medium heat in a frypan with some oil. Serving Suggestions: In the
  Colder months this meal is best served with Mashed potato and gravy
  as well as carrots and any other vegetables you like.
  
  In the Warm months my very favourite is a Schnitzel Burger. I put the
  lettuce on the bottom,Beetroot next,then the scnitzel,then a thin
  pineapple ring,and mayo.Excellent in summer months.2 of these make a
  filling and tasty meal.
  
  Well there you go.And comments and critisism would be appreciated.
  CYA!

    1/2    Vanilla bean, split
      3    Coriander seeds
      1    Whole clove
    1/4 ts Five-spice powder
           Zest of 1 lime
           Zest of 1/2 lemon
    1/2 ts Chopped fresh ginger
      1    Sprig of fresh mint (OPT)
      1 tb Fresh lime juice
      1    Pineapple
      1    Mango
      2    Large kiwis
      2    Passion fruits
 
  And ideal fruit salad or dessert for Winter, because the tropical
  fruits are available year-round and ripen naturally. The riper and
  more fragrant the fruit, the better the salad. 
  In a small saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups water with the sugar, vanilla
  bean, coriander seeds, clove, five-spice powder, lime and lemon
  zests, ginger, and mint, if using. Simmer over moderate heat for 10
  minutes. Set aside to cook.  Then stir in the lime juice. (The syrup
  can be made up and refrigerated for up to a week before serving the
  salad.) 
  Slice off the top and the rind from the pineapple; quarter it
  lengthwise. Reserve 3 of the quarters for another use. Slice 1 of the
  quarters crosswise 1/8-inch thick. Using a sharp paring knife, peel
  the mango and slice lengthwise, parallel to the pit on both sides,
  into disks 1/8-inch thick.  Slice each mango disk in half lengthwise.
  Peel the kiwis and halve lengthwise.  Cut each half lengthwise into
  thin wedges. 
  Divide the fruit evenly and arrange in each of 4 shallow soup bowls,
  overlapping the slices to form a decorative pattern. Strain the
  reserved syrup and divide equally among the 4 servings. Cover with
  plastic wrap and refirgerate for at least 1 or up to 4 hours. Just
  before serving, halve the passion fruits crosswise. Using a teaspoon,
  scoop the pulk out of each half onto the fruit in each bowl. 

   Trim the fat from the stew meat, cut into bite sized chunks and
  brown it. Chop the onion and the jalapeno chili. Smash the garlic.
  Throw every thing but the beans into a pot, add water and simmer
  until meat is tender.
   Put the beans into a pot with water and bring to a boil, turn the
  heat down and simmer till the beans are done.
   Eat the chili and stomp the hell out of the beans.
   Don't confuse this with "Rebel Chile" which also has the beans
  stomped out of it.
   I brought this recipe back from Mexico and it was said to be the one
  that Mexico used when they taught Texans how to make chili at the
  Alamo. I understand that to this day Texans do not put beans in chili.

      2 qt Water
  3 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 pt White vinegar
    1/2 ts Oil of cloves
    1/2 ts Oil of cinnamon
 
  Cut kelp in 12 inch lengths and split bulbs.  Remove dark surface
  layer with a vegetable parer.  Soak 2 hours in brine solution
  prepared by dissolving 1 cup salt in 2 gallons water. Care must be
  taken to keep kelp covered with brine.  Remove kelp from brine and
  wash thoroughly with cold water.
  
  Cut kelp into 1 inch cubes and soak in alum solution (1/2 teaspoon
  alum to 2 quarts water) for 15 minutes. Drain and wash in cold water;
  drain again. Place in enamel kettle and cover with boiling water.
  Cook only until kelp can be pierced with a fork.  Drain.
  
  Combine sugar, vinegar and oils; boil 2 minutes; pour over cooked
  kelp. Let stand ovenight in an enamel kettle or crock. In the morning
  drain off syrup and reheat to boiling point. Pour back over kelp and
  allow to stand 24 hours.  The third morning, heat both kelp and syrup
  to boiling point. Pack in hot sterilized jars and seal while hot.
  
  NOTE:  The giant kelp is easily recognized by the floating bulb
  attached to a long, hollow stem rooted to the bottom of a shallow bay
  or channel. Gather during June, July and August when the kelp is in
  its prime. Use only the ones rooted to the bottom.  The kelp is
  washed, peeled and used the same as green tomatoes or cucumbers for
  pickles and relishes.

      Title: ALASKAN SOURDOUGH FRUITCAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Golden, seedless, and puffed
           -seeded raisins, combined
      4 c  White flour
      1 ts Baking soda
  1 1/2 c  Dried currants
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Plus 2 tb Blackberry Cordial
           -or other wine
      1 ts Cinnamon
      1 ts Cloves
      1 ts Allspice
      1 c  Alaskan Sourdough Starter
    1/2 ts Mace
      6 tb Butter
      3 c  Candied fruit; green and red
           -cherries, pineapple,
           -orange, citron and ging
      1 c  White sugar
      1 c  Brown sugar
      3    Eggs, well beaten
      1 c  Chopped nuts
      2 tb Grated lemon rind
 
  Soak raisins and currants in 1 cup wine overnight. Remove starter from
  refrigerator and set, tightly covered, in warm place overnight. It
  should be in at least a two cup container as it will just about
  double its volume overnight.  In the morning, cream butter with sugar
  and beat in eggs and lemon rind.  Drain wine from raisins into
  creamed mixture. Stir in starter and 3 cups of the flour sifted with
  the soda, salt and spices. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of flour over
  the fruit and nuts in a large bowl. Toss and shake until well-coated.
  Add to batter and mix thoroughly. Turn into loaf pans which have been
  generously buttered. Let stand in warm place for 30 minutes.  Bake in
  oven preheated to 300 with a pan of water on floor of oven and rack
  as near as possible in middle of oven. Bake about 2-1/2 hours for
  medium-sized loaves watching carefully to see that they do not brown
  to quickly. Test with toothpick. Remove from oven, turn pans on sides
  and allow to set for a few minutes before taking from pans. When cold
  drip 2 tbsp. of wine over each cake. As soon as it is absorbed, wrap
  tightly in cellophane freezer paper and store in refrigerator or
  freezer. They improve with age.

 Categories: Game, Native, Canadian, Sauces, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Licorice fern root
      2 tb Gewurztraminer icewine
    3/4 c  Water
      3 c  Dried alder cones
      2    Wild grouse breasts, bone in
           -and skinless
           Juniper & Salal Berry Sauce:
  1 1/3 c  Water
  1 1/2 c  B.C. Pinot Blanc wine
  3 1/2 c  Salal Berries
  1 1/2 tb Maple syrup
  1 1/2 tb Black peppercorns
      8    Juniper berries
  1 1/2 tb Balsamic vinegar
 
  Recipe from Northern Bounty: A Celebration of Canadian Cuisine. The
  ISBN is 0-394-22431-0. Recipe by Sinclair Philip, owner of the Sooke
  Harbour House on Vancouver Island.  Sinclair believes in local
  ingredients, freshness and learning about and using wild ingredients
  from the native peoples. His restaurant has vegetable and herb
  gardens full of plants transplanted from the bush for use in the
  kitchen. At Sooke, chefs prepare this dish with a salad of foraged
  wild greens and flowers: amaranth, chicory, chickweed, lamb's
  quarters, orache, shepherd's purse, and sorrel.
  
  Alder: a deciduous tree, member of the birch family with woody cone
  like fruits. Common in swamps and mountainous areas. [ I am going to
  try black spruce cones- our commonest local tree. (Update: this was a
  terrible idea- bitter tarry smoked taste) If that doesn't work I can
  fall back on store bought fruit wood chips or do a Chinese Tea
  Smoke.- JW]
  
  Licorice Fern: I have no idea what it's geographic range is or what
  flavor it's root would impart. Based on it's name I am going to try
  diced Fennel bulb, Fennel seed or a _wee_ bit of Star Anise stewed in
  Port instead.-JW
  
  Salal Berries: Salal is a low [up to 2 meter] evergreen shrub of the
  Heath family native to California, B.C. and Alaska with white to pink
  urn shaped flowers and round purple berries which turn black. [There
   are none locally so I will be experimenting with cranberries or
  black currants.- JW]
  
  Directions:
  
  In a small covered sauce pan, gently simmer fern root in icewine and
  water for 20 min. Pour into a glass jar, seal and let stand at room
  temp for 12 hours. Strain into a small saucepan and boil, uncovered,
  on high until reduced to a thick syrup. Set aside.
  
  Heat alder cones in a large aluminum foil lined sauce pan over high
  heat until they smoulder. Reduce heat to low; place grouse breasts
  directly on top of the smouldering cones. Lightly brush the breasts
  with the fern root glaze; cover pan tightly. Smoke breasts for 3
  hours or until cooked but not dry. Remove the meat from the bone and
  serve with Juniper-Salal Berry Sauce.
  
  For the sauce: Pour 1 cup water and the wine into the bottom of a per-
  forated double boiler. Place the salal berries in the top section.
  Cover; simmer gently for two hours. Gently press berries with a
  rubber spatula to extract remaining juice. Discard berries; reserving
  syrup in the bottom of the double boiler.
  
  To the salal syrup, add the maple syrup, peppercorns, juniper berries,
  remaining water and balsamic vinegar. Bring to the boil and
  immediately remove from the heat; let stand an hour before returning
  to the heat. Cook, uncovered, until slightly thickened. Refrigerate
  until needed.

      Title: ALEECHA
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Onion; sliced
     10 cl Garlic; sliced thin
      2 c  Carrots; sliced thin
      1 c  Water
      3 tb Corn oil
      1 ts Tumeric; ground
      1 ea Fresh hot green peppers
           -halved, to 3 peppers
      1 lb Cabbage; coarsely sliced
      1 ts Queman; see note
      1 tb Tomato paste
      1 ts Salt; to taste
      1 lb Potatoes; cut like french
           -fries
 
  Aleecha is a mixed vegetable stew. Quemam contains an ingredient not
  found in the US. I'd substitute dry berebere. In dry pan over
  moderate low heat, stir fry onion, garlic, and carrots for 2 mins.
  Add 1/2c of the water and cook  5 mins longer. Add the oil and
  continue to simmer.
  
  Add the tumeric, chilies, and cabbage.  Cover the pan and steam to
  reduce the bulk for 2 mins.  Stir well and add the quemam, tomato
  paste, salt and the potatoes.
  
  Cover the pan and cook for 5 mins.  Add the remaining water and
  simmer for 5 minutes more to soften the potatoes and thicken the
  sauce somewhat.
  
  Serve at room temperature with Injeera.

      Title: ALEKSANDER TORTE / RASPBERRY-FILLED PASTRY ST
 Categories: Cakes, Cookies
      Yield: 48 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Unsalted butter, chilled and
           Cut into bits
  3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      3 tb Sugar
      1    Egg
  1 1/2 c  Raspberry preserves (12 oz)
      2 tb Soft butter
      2 c  Confectioner's sugar
    1/4 c  Cold water
      2 ts Lemon juice
 
  In a large mixing bowl, combine the chilled butter, 3 cups of the
  flour and the sugar and, with your fingertips, rub until the mixture
  resembles flakes of coarse meal. Beat in the egg and continue to mix
  until the pastry is smooth.  Shape it into a ball, wrap it in wax
  paper, and refrigerate 1 hour, or until the dough is form.
  
  With the back of a spoon, rub the preserves through a fine sieve set
  over a 1-quart saucepan, then cook over moderate heat, stirring
  constantly, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they thicken into a thin
  puree. Set aside off the heat.
  
  Preheat the oven to 250F.  Cut the chilled pastry in half and shape
  each half into a rectangle.  One half at a time, roll the pastry
  between two sheets of lightly floured wax paper into a rectangle
  approximately 10 inches wide and 15 inches long.  With a pastry
  brush, coat each of 2 cookie sheets with 1 tablespoon of butter and
  sprinkle them with flour, tipping the sheets from side to side to
  coat them evenly. Then invert the sheets and tap them against a hard
  surface to dislodge any excess flour. Peel off the top sheets of wax
  paper and use the bottom ones to lift the 2 rectangles of pastry onto
  the 2 cookie sheets. Peel off the remaining sheets of wax paper. Bake
  40 minutes, or until the pastry begins to turn a pale gold.  Watch
  carefully for any sign of burning and regulate the heat accordingly.
  
  With a metal spatula, spread the raspberry puree evenly over one
  sheet of the pastry, covering it completely and smoothly. Slide the
  second sheet of pastry gently onto the first.
  
  With a spoon stir the sugar, water and lemon juice together in a large
  mixing bowl to form a thin paste. Spread the icing over the top layer
  of pastry with the spatula, and set the cake aside to cool to room
  temperature.  With a small, sharp knife or pastry wheel, slice the
  Aleksander Torte into strips 1 inch wide and 2 inches long, cutting
  the ends on the diagonal.

      Title: ALEXANDRIAN CUMIN BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
           Flour
      1 pk Dried yeast
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Cumin seed, ground
      1 c  Plus 3 oz. lukewarm water
 
     1) Place the flour, yeast, salt, and ground cumin in a large mixing
  bowl.  Blend well.  Add the water and mix the dough for 2-3 minutes,
  until all the water is absorbed and evenly distributed. The dough
  will be damp and very sticky, but no internal dry areas should appear
  by the end of the mixing.  If they do, mix a few minutes more, or add
  a little more water and mix again.
  
     2) Let the dough rest 5 minutes.  Now sprinkle 1 or 2 tbsps. flour
  over the dough and knead, either in the bowl or on a lightly floured
  surface for 5-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic and
  only slightly sticky.  Add more flour if needed (e.g. in humid
  weather). Let the dough rest for 2 minutes more.
  
     3) The dough should now be very smooth and easy to handle. Knead 30
  seconds more, return the dough to the bowl, cover the bowl with a dish
  towel or large plate, and let rise at room temperature for at least 3
  hours; the dough should almost triple in size.
  
     4) Flour the top of the dough lightly, punch it down, and remove
  the dough from the mixing bowl.  Form the dough into a rectangular
  loaf and place in a well greasad loaf pan, 9-1/4 in. by 5-1/4 in. by
  2-3/4 in. Cover with a towel and let rise 1 hr., until nicely risen.
  
     5) Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35 minutes, until
  browned on top; the bottom of the bread should sound hollow when
  tapped with the finger.  Let the bread cool, then serve.

 Categories: Stew chili, Beans
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
 
        1 lb (2 cups) small navy beans --
  :          soaked
      1/4 c  olive oil
        1 lg onion -- finely diced

        2    tomatoes -- coarsely
  :          chopped
        7 c  water -- or
  :          vegetable broth
        2    bay leaves
      1/8 ts cayenne -- or to taste
       20    sprigs fresh flat-leaf
  :          parsley -- chopped
    2 1/2 ts salt
       10    sprigs fresh cilantro --

  :          Cider vinegar -- or
  :          red wine vinegar --
  :          optional
  
  LOUBIA is an Algerian speciality that gets its flavor from DERSA, a
  spicy blend of ground dried red chilies (use New Mexican in the US),
  garlic, and ground cumin. Dersa is a predominant season ing in the
  cuisine. A dash of vinegar is traditionally added to each bowl of
  Loubia on serving.
  
  Soak and drain the beans. Set aside. SOAKING BEANS: Rinse and pick
  over the beans and soak them overnight in a bowl of water to cover.
  Drain and proceed with the recipe. For the quick-soak method, place
  the beans in a large soup pot and add 10 cups of hot water. Bring
  them to a rolling boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and let
  the beans stand in the cooking water for at least 1 hour, and
  preferable longer. Drain the beans and proceed with the recipe. The
  older the beans, the longer they will take to cook. (She recommends
  adding salt to the cooking water: up to 2 teaspoons per pound of
  dried beans.)
  
  In a large soup pop over medium high heat, heat the oil, and cook the
  onion, stirring occasionally, until tender; 6 to 8 minutes. Add the
  chilies, garlic, paprika, pepper, and cumin. Cook, stirring, for 2 to
  3 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until the mixture
  thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and 1 cup of the water
  or broth and bring to a boil. Add the beans, the remaining 6 cups
  water or broth, the bay leaves, cayenne, and
       10    of the parsley sprigs tied together with cotton string.
  Mince the remaining parsley and set aside. Lower the heat to medium
  low, cover, and cook the beans until tender, 1 to 2 hours.
  
  Before serving, discard the chilies, bay leaves, and tied parsley.
  Season with salt. Stir in the reserved minced parsley and cilantro.
  Serve hot with vinegar on the side, if you like.

      3 tb Oil
      1    Pimento
      4    Tomatoes, seeded, chopped

      7 oz Fresh string beans or peas
      9 oz Can artichoke bottoms
           Drained
           Cayenne pepper
      4 oz Butter
 
  Place couscous in shallow pan with 4 cups water. Swirl and pour off
  water immediately in a sieve. Rub couscous well between hands and
  drop back into pan, making sure couscous is lump free. Let this dry
  while preparing remainders. Fry onions garlic, pepper, carrot and
  eggplant with chicken and lamb in oil. Then add chickpeas( if using
  dried ones ) and enough water to cover. Add pimento and salt and
  pepper to taste,Bring to a boil and fasten colander over kettle to
  fit snugly. Spoon couscous into colander and let steam for 45
  minutes, then dump couscous back into pan to let dry again. Add
  tomatoes, beans or peas and cook another 1/2 hour. Now attach
  colander and let couscous steam another 15 minutes. Add artichoke,
  canned chickpeas to the stew.  Cook a few minutes longer. Add some
  butter to the couscous and place couscous shaped into a cone on a
  serving platter. surround by meat and vegetables. Note: this is only
  one version of many different types of couscous preparation. It is
  thought that the name of this grain comes from the soft rumbling
  noise that the couscous makes in a steamer. There is a special
  couscous pot but a colander can suffice.

      Title: ALHEIRAS DE MIRANDELA
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 15 Units
 
      3 lb Lean beef*
  1 1/2 lb Calf meat
    1/2 lb Chicken
    1/2 lb Turkey
    1/2 lb Rabbit
  1 1/2 lb Day old wheat bread
    1/4 lb Ham (optional)
      4    Garlic cloves
      4 ts Olive oil
      2 oz Pork drippings**
           Paprika, salt and
           -piripiri to taste
     10    Feet tripe casing
 
  *    Or lean pork, or a mixture of both, for cost reasons. **
  Probably a modern addition, or replacement for suet. You may change
  the proportions of chicken/turkey/rabbit - it may be all chicken,
  etc., provided the total amount remains the same. You can use
  partridge, quail, duck, and so on... Boil the meats together long
  enough to make the bones separate from the meat by themselves.
  Reserve the resulting broth and set meats aside. In a large bowl
  place the thinly sliced bread and add the reserved broth. Cover with
  a towel and, as soon as the bread is soft enough, mash it with an
  wooden spoon. Add the mashed garlic and ground piripiri, paprika and
  a little salt. Add the meats cut in very little pieces. Mix
  thoroughly. When everything is completely mixed add the olive oil and
  the pork drippings, hot. Fill the casing using a suitable funnel. Tie
  each 'alheira' so that it's about 8" long, with the filling
  concentrated in the middle section, leaving the ends almost empty.
  Smoke for 2 or 3 hours a day, for a week. Tie both ends together
  before selling or using - the 'alheira' should be U shaped. A typical
  way of serving 'alheiras' is frying them in hot oil, and presenting
  them with fried eggs and potato chips. Some add broccoli as a side
  dish.

      1 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Butter flavored Crisco or 2
           Sticks (1/4 lb
    2/3 c  Milk
      1 tb Vanilla
 
  Mix sugar and Crisco together.  Heat milk until hot on finger. (Do not
  boil.)  Add half of the milk to sugar ~ Crisco mixture and beat 2
  minutes. Add rest of milk and beat 8 minutes longer (a total of 10
  minutes all together). The beating breaks up the sugar granules to a
  whipped cream consistency, but is a butter type.
  
  To make a whipped cream frosting, use white Crisco instead of
  butter-flavored. (This is Audrey's (my sister-in-laws recipe.) (I use
  these often as I don't always have confectioners sugar on hand.)

  It was good, but much more of a stew than a sauce. Next time I make

  good...

  The many forms of Buckwheat!:
  
  Buckwheat Seed:  It's a fruit, not a grain.  Planted around the world.
  Triangular hard hull.  Fresh seeds can be sprouted; ready-to-eat in
  about 5 days.
  
  Kasha:  Hulled and roasted to bring out distinctive, nutlike flavor.
  Packaged four ways; whole, coarse, medium, fine.
  
  Whole Buckwheat Groats:  Hulled and unroasted. Mild-flavored. Better
  than barley or rice!
  
  Cream of Buckwheat:  100% pure groats milled to the size of sesame
  seeds. Look like corn grits and other "cream of..." cereals, but
  taste better.
  
  Buckwheat Flour:  Both light and whole buckwheat flour are 100%
  buckwheat. Gluten-free.  For fiber and flavor, each contains very
  finely milled particles of buckwheat hulls (more in whole flour).

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------HOW TO MELT CHOCOLATE------------------------
 
    Always melt chocolate with gentle heat because it scorches easily.
  If chocolate is to be melted alone, make certain that the container
  and utensils are absolutely dry; a tiny drop of moisture will cause
  the chocolate to become lumpy and stiff.  If this should happen, stir
  in one teaspoon of vegetable shortening for each ounce of chocolate.
  Remember that unsweetened chocolate liquifies when melted, but
  semisweet and baking chocolate will hold their shapes until stirred.
  For faster melting, cut or chop chocolate into smaller pieces. To
  melt chocolate, place it in a heavy saucepan over low heat and stir
  until melted. Or, place chocolate in top of a double boiler and melt
  over hot water, stirring until smooth.
    To melt chocolate in a microwave oven, place a 1-ounce square in a
  1-cup glass measure.  Microwave, uncovered, at MEDIUM (50% power) for
  1 to 2 minutes or until chocolate is almost melted. Stir until
  completely melted and smooth.  Add 10 seconds for each additional
  ounce of chocolate. To melt chocolate morsels in a microwave oven,
  place 1 cup chocolate morsels in a 2-cup measure.  Microwave,
  uncovered, at MEDIUM (50% power) for 2 to 4 minutes or until morsels
  are glossy. Stir until smooth. Formatted by Rose Capoccia drnd29a

  CHOCOLATE LEAVES:  Select non-poisonous leaves such as mint or rose
  leaves. Wash the leaves and pat dry with paper towels. Melt 1 or 2
  (1-ounce) squares semisweet chocolate over hot water in a double
  boiler; let cool slightly.  Using a small spatula, spread a thin
  layer of chocolate on the back of each leaf.  Place leaves on a wax
  paper-lined cookie sheet, chocolate side up; freeze until chocolate
  is firm, about 10 minutes. Grasp leaf at stem end and carefully peel
  away from chocolate. Chill leaves until ready to use.
  
  CHOCOLATE CURLS:  Melt 4 (1-ouce) squares semisweet chocolate over hot
  water in a double bliler.  Pour chocolate out into a wax paper-lined
  cookie sheet. Spread chocolate with a spatula into a 3-inch-wide
  strip. Smooth top with a spatula.  Chill chocolate until it feels
  slightly tacky but not firm.  (If too hard, curls will break; if too
  soft, chocolate will not curl.)  Gently pull a vegetable peeler
  across chocolate until curls form. Transfer curls to a tray by
  inserting a wooden pick in end of curl. Chill curls until ready to
  use. CHOCOLATE-DIPPED FRUIT: Make sure fruit is completely dry before
  dipping. Melt 4 (1-ounce) squares semisweet chocolate over hot vater
  in a double boiler; transfer to a small bowl, and let cool slightly.
  Grasp fruit by stem and dip in chocolate, turning to coat the bottom
  of the fruit. Allow excess to drip back into bowl. Lay fruit on side
  on a wax paper-lined cookie sheet. Allow fruit to stand at room
  temperature until chocolate hardens or place in refrigerator about 10
  minutes. Don't store coated fruit in refrigerator; the chocolate
  coating will sweat when returned to room temperature and will lose
  its sheen. CHOCOLATE CUTOUTS: Melt 6 (1-ounce) squares semisweet
  chocolate over hot water in a double boiler; cool slightly. Line a
  cookie sheet with aluminum foil; pour the chocolate onto the cookie
  sheet, and gently shake it until chocolate is smooth and level and
  about 1/8-inch thick. Let stand until partially set. Press a cookie
  cutter half-way through the chocolate to outline shapes. Remove the
  cutter, and let stand until chocolate is firm. When hard, reposition
  the cutter over the oulines, and press down to cut smoothly. Lift the
  cutter up, and remove the cutout by gently pressing through the
  cutter with a small wooden utensil (fingers will leave prints on
  chocolate). GRATED CHOCOLATE: You can grate unsweetened, semisweet,
  or milk chocolate to sprinkle on top of pies, etc. It's easiest done
  in a food processor, but you can grate it by hand. When grating by
  hand, hold chocolate with a paper towel or wax paper so heat from
  your hand will not soften or melt the chocolate.

      Title: ALL ABOUT CHOCOLATE - COOKING TIPS
 Categories: Chocolate, Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
    MELTING CHOCOLATE
  
    Chocolate scorches easily, so always melt it over hot - not boiling
  ~ water.  It is best to use a double boiler, but you can improvise by
  using a c  or bowl in a small saucepan over very gentle heat. The
  water must be kept below simmering to prevent steam from curling up
  and hitting the chocolate. If steam gets into the melted chocolate it
  will immediately thicken the mixture to a stiff mass. If this does
  happen, however, you can rescue the chocolate by softening it again.
  To do this, add 1-2 tb of vegetable shortening (never use butter as
  it contains moisture which will cause the chocolate stiffen even
  more!) to the chocolate and stir vigorously.  You can also melt
  chocolate directly over very low heat in a heavy gauge saucepan, but
  you must watch the mixture carefully.
  
    HOW TO MAKE CHOCOLATE CURLS
  
    Use a vegetable peeler with a long narrow blade and a chunk or bar
  of chocolate.  Warm chocolate and blade slightly. Be sure your peeler
  is absolutely dry. Draw the peeler along the smooth surface of the
  chocolate.
  
  HOW TO GRATE CHOCOLATE
  
    Be sure that the block of chocolate is cool and firm. Grate on hand
  grater, cleaning the grater often so that the chocolate doesn't clog
  the surface of the blade. You cn use a blender, but be sure to cut the
  chocolate into sm pieces first.
  
  HOW TO STORE CHOCOLATE
  
    Chocolate should be stored in a cool, dry place at a temperature of
  about 60F. If the chocolate becomes too warm, the cocoa butter rises
  to the surface and forms a dusty gray film known as "bloom." This
  "bloom" is not harmful and, once the chocolate is melted, it returns
  to its natural rich brown color.  If you do store chocolate in the
  refrigerator or freezer, take in out and let it stand until it
  returns to room temperature before you use it in a recipe. Chocolate
  is very sensitive to sudden changes of temperature and you will not
  get the best results if you do not treat it with respect.

      Title: ALL SOUTH BARBEQUE RUB
 Categories: Sauces, Rubs
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 tb Salt
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Brown sugar
      2 tb Ground cumin
      2 tb Chile powder
      2 tb Freshly cracked black
           Pepper
      1 tb Cayenne pepper
      4 tb Paprika
 
  The rub is the second most important part of the BBQ process, next to
  the smoking technique. There are two main concepts to keep in mind
  when formulating your rub. The proportion of salt should be great
  enough to trigger osmosis and begin to draw the moisture from the
  surface of the meat, and (some may disagree with this) the proportion
  of sugar should not be excessive because it will caramelize and burn
  during smoking leaving a bitter taste.  However, since sugar
  contributes to osmosis, it is an important component and shouldn't be
  eliminated.
  
  Beyond that, your rub should only be limited by your imagination.
  Other ingredients to consider can include paprika, cumin, garlic
  powder, onion powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, chile powder,
  oregano, sage or whatever sounds good to you.
  
  I like to keep my rub in a shaker for easy application. Rub should be
  applied at least the night before smoking. Anything longer, up to
  three days, is better. Shake the rub over the entire surface of the
  meat to be smoked.  Use a generous amount at first and then, as it
  starts to get moist and adhere, add more. I don't think it's
  necessary to "rub" it in. I find that that only results in uneven
  distribution, and besides, it stains your hands.  Wrap the meat
  loosely in butcher paper and leave in the fridge until a couple of
  hours before smoking.
  
  I find rubs to be far more useful than marinades especially for large
  pieces of meat such as briskets and pork butts. For cuts such as
  these, the internal and external fat melt through the meat during
  cooking to keep it moist.  I believe that the texture of the meat is
  improved by drawing out excess moisture, before cooking, through
  osmosis. The dry surface of the meat and the rub itself combine to
  produce a flavorful and attractive crust on the finished product.
  Unless it is thoroughly blotted dry on the surface, marinated meat
  won't color properly.

      Title: ALL-AMERICAN COLE SLAW
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Green cabbage; quartered,
           -   cored, and shredded fine
      3 tb Vinegar; cider, malt, distld
    2/3 c  Mayonnaise
      1    Onion, small; grated (optnl)
      2    Carrot, medium; grated
    1/4 ts Salt
 
     In a large mixing bowl, toss the cabbage with the vinegar and salt.
  Grate the carrots and optional onion directly into the bowl. Add the
  mayonnaise and toss well.
     The slaw can be served immediately, but it is much better -- more
  melded and tender -- if allowed to stand and tossed occasionally for
  30 minutes to 1 hour. For a very limp slaw, refrigerate several hours
  or overnight.
  
  ^^^^^^^^^^
     The law on cole slaw is cabbage and vinegar.  All the rest is
  interpretation.  Adjust the recipe to taste: Add more mayonnaise,
  substitute sour cream or yogurt for some (but not all) of the
  mayonnaise, or add a supplement of one or the other. Add diced green
  and/or red pepper if you have one, celery or caraway seeds if you
  like that kind of thing, or shredded celery for an extra fresh taste.

      Title: ALL-AMERICAN PIE PASTRY
 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Frozen lard or shortening
           - cut into bits
      3 tb Ice water
 
  To ensure a tender crust, this recipe should not be doubled.
  Thoroughly freezing the lard or shortening will give you the flakiest
  crust.
  
  PLACE THE FLOUR AND SALT in the bowl of a food processor and pulse 2-3
  times. Scatter the lard or shortening over the flour mixture.
  Sprinkle with the water and process about 5 seconds or until dough
  just begins to form. Shape into a ball, then flatten it slightly.
  Dust lightly with flour and place in the center of a 2-gallon-size
  plastic storage bag. It may be refrigerated at this point up to 40
  minutes. With the storage bag open and the dough circle centered in
  the bag, roll the dough into a circle that almost touches the edges
  of the bag. Cut and discard the top sheet of the plastic bag so that
  the dough is lying on the bottom sheet. Flip onto the pie plate; peel
  the plastic off and discard. Cut the pastry so it hangs about an inch
  over the rim. Lightly press the overhanging pastry under (between the
  pastry and the pie tin). Pinch or crease the edges of the pastry in a
  zigzag or fluted pattern. This is not only decorative, it also acts
  as a wall to keep the filling in. Yield: 1 single-crust 8- to 10-inch
  pie shell.

      Title: ALL-DAY-LONG CROCKPOT BEEF
 Categories: Crockpot, Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Beef roast; * see note
    1/2 ts Black pepper
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
    1/2 pk Onion soup mix
      2 ts Worcestershire sauce
      1 ts Steak sauce
      3    Carrots; sliced
      2    Celery stalks; diced
      1    Green bell pepper; chopped
      1    Yellow onion
    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Tomato juice
 
  Recipe by: Jo Anne Merrill Preparation Time: 8:00 * Use any cut of
  beef roast desired.
  
       1. Cut beef roast into serving-sized portions. Use more beef if
  you need more than 6 servings. Brown beef in a bit of vegetable oil,
  although you can skip this step if rushed for time.
       2. Slice onion and separate into rings. Dice the peeled carrots,
  dice the celery and slice the peppers into thin strips or circles.
  Place these into bottom of crockpot. Sprinkle the beef pieces with
  fresh ground black pepper, minced garlic and the onion soup mix.
  Place on top of the vegetables.
       3. Mix the steak sauce and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl
  with about 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup tomato juice. Pour this over the
  meat.
       4. Turn the crockpot to high for 30 minutes, or, if you're in a
  hurry, skip this step. Turn to low, cover and cook for 7-9 hours.
  
  * Keep the crockpot covered as much as possible throughout cooking
  time. A crockpot can be used to cook this type of meal for a varied
  amount of time, depending on your schedule. It is not important that
  you take the meat and vegetables out at a specific amount of time.
  One or two hours either way usually makes no difference.
  
       When ready to serve, dip meat and vegetables out of pot with a
  slotted spoon. Use the liquid as is or turn crockpot to high and
  thicken liquid with a little flour or cornstarch.

      Title: ALL-PURPOSE POTATO-BASED GRAVY
 Categories: Potatoes, Sauces, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 sm Or 1 lg potato
      1 c  Water
      1    Brown onion -- coursely
           Minced
           Coursely ground black
           Pepper
           Olive oil -- amt. opt
           Veggie stock concentrate --
           (such as Vegex
           Or Organic Gourmet
           Vegetable
           Broth concentrate) -- to
           Taste
 
  (Optional: Any combination of stuff like poppy seeds, celery seeds,
  toasted sesame seeds, Lawry's Seasoned Salt) Microwave the potato(s)
  for about 8 minutes more or less, depending on your potato(s) and
  your microwave. Then, put them in a blender (do not peel) with the
  water and whirl until you have a puree. Set aside. In a hot skillet
  (I use my trusty electric wok), saute the onion in the olive oil
  until it's the way you like it. Pour in the potato puree, and moosh
  it around, cooking the hell out of it until it's also the way you
  like it (is there any other way?), adding seasonings to taste. That's
  it!  This is great over steamed veggies or grains or biscuits or
  toast  or eggs or corn on the cob or spinach even potatos! You could
  try it over ice cream or fruit salad but you'd be really weird.

      1 c  Dried mixed fruit
      1 c  Sugar

  Soak first four ingredients together for at least 1 hour. Mix the
  flour in well, and put into a greased lined loaf tin and bake for
  approximately 1 hour at 180C (GM4 375F). The cake is delicious, and
  served in slices with a little margarine on. If you wrap it in foil
  and keep for a few days (if it lasts that long) the flavour gets even
  better. The all-bran is available in the UK as Kellogg's AllBran.
  It's sort of little sticks of high-fibre bran stuff. If you can't get
  it in the US, I don't know what the equivalent is (not having been to
  the US myself).

  ROASTED RICE POWDER (THINH) Roasted rice powder is used as a
  flavoring and binding agent in various recipes throughout this book.
  It is necessary to soak the rice first in order to obtain a deep
  golden color after roasting. Soaking also makes the rice easier to
  grind. 1/2 cup raw glutinous rice Soak the glutinous rice in warm
  water for 1 hour. Drain. Place the rice in a small skillet over
  moderate heat.  Toast the rice, stirring constantly with chopsticks
  or a wooden spoon, until deep golden brown, about 15 minutes.
  Transfer the roasted rice to a spice grinder or blender and process
  to a fine powder (the powder should resemble saw dust). Sift the
  ground rice through a very fine sieve into a bowl. Discard the grainy
  bits. Store the rice powder in a tightly covered jar in your
  refrigerator and use as needed. It will keep for up to 3 months.
  Yield: 1 cup. SCALLION OIL (HANH LA PHI): Many Vietnamese dishes
  require this delicate scallionflavored oil. Brushed over noodles,
  barbecued meats, vegetables or breads, it complements each item. 1/4
  cup peanut oil, 2 scallions, finely sliced Heat the oil in a small
  saucepan until hot but not smoking, about 300F. Remove the pan from
  the heat and add the sliced scallions. Let the mixture steep at room
  temperature until completely cooled. This oil mixture will keep
  stored in a tightly covered jar at room temperature for 1 week.
  Yield: 1/4 cup CRISP FRIED SHALLOTS (HANH KHO PHI): This is an
  important ingredient in his many dishes throughout this book. Use as
  specified in recipes. 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup thinly sliced
  shallots Heat the oil in a small saucepan until hot but not smoking,
  about 300F. Add the shallots and fry over moderate heat until crispy
  and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Do not overcook.  Immediately
  remove the shallots with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
  Reserve the oil for another use. Cooked this way, shallots can be
  stored in a tightly covered jar on the kitchen shelf for up to 1
  month.  Yield: about 1/3 cup. ROASTED PEANUTS (DAU PHONG RANG): Use
  shelled and skinned unsalted peanuts for this purpose. Cook a small
  amount at a time and use shortly after they are roasted to preserve
  their flavor. Amounts are specified in recipes using roasted peanuts.
  Place the peanuts in a skillet over moderate heat and cook, stirring
  constantly, until the nuts turn golden brown, about 5 minutes. Allow
  to cool. Pound in a mortar with a pestle or process in a spice
  grinder until the peanuts are a bit chunky. Store-bought
  dry-roasted-roasted unsalted peanuts may be substituted in recipes
  calling for roasted peanuts. PEANUT SAUCE (NUOC LEO): This delicious
  sauce originated in the central region and is used as a dip for many
  dishes in this book. Usually, tuong, a fermented soybean sauce, and
  glutinous rice are used to produce this sauce. After several
  experiments, I ended up with this variation where tuong and glutinous
  rice are replaced by hoisin sauce and peanut butter, ingredients that
  are more readily available. 1/4 cup roasted peanuts, ground, 1
  tablespoon peanut oil, 2 garlic cloves, minced, 1 teaspoon chili
  paste (tuong ot tuoi), 2 tablespoons tomato paste, 1/2 cup chicken
  broth or water, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, 1 tablespoon peanut butter, 1/4
  cup hoisin sauce, 1 fresh red chile pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
  Prepare the roasted peanuts. Set aside. Heat the oil in a small
  saucepan. When the oil is hot, add the garlic, chili paste and tomato
  paste, Fry until the garlic is golden brown, about 30 seconds. Add
  the broth, sugar, peanut butter and hoisin sauce and whisk to
  dissolve the peanut butter. Bring to a boil, Reduce the heat and
  simmer for 3 minutes. Divide the sauce among individual dipping bowls
  and garnish with the ground peanuts and sliced chile. Serve warm or
  at room temperature. Yield: About 1 cup. VEGETABLE PLATTER (DIA RAU
  SONG): Vietnamese meals include an abundance of fresh lettuce, herbs,
  unripe fruits and raw vegetables. These are arranged attractively on
  a platter and are used for wrapping cooked foods at the table,
  usually dipped in Nuoc Cham and eaten out of hand. The following
  herbs, both very important to the Vietnamese, would be authentic
  additions to the Vegetable Platter: One is the "saw leaf herb"
  (Eryngium foetidum, or ngo gai in Vietnamese), a coriander relative.
  The other is polygonum (P. pulchrum or rau ram in Vietnamese), with
  pinkish stems, pointed green leaves and purplish markings. They can
  be found occasionally at Southeast Asian markets. If you have access
  to unripe mango, banana, papaya or apple and star fruit (carambola),
  add them to the platter. You may select or substitute the ingredients
  according to availability and personal taste. 1 large head of Boston
  or other soft lettuce, separated into individual leaves, 1 bunch of
  scallions, cut into 2 inch lengths, 1 cup coriander leaves, 1 cup
  mint leaves, 1 cup fresh Asian or regular basil leaves, 1 cucumber,
  peeled in alternating strips, halved lengthwise and sliced thinly
  crosswise, 4 ounces fresh bean sprouts On a large platter,
  decoratively arrange all of the ingredients in separate groups. Use
  in recipes where required. Yield: 4 to 6 servings

 Categories: Meats, Game, Southern
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Lime
      1 g  Water
      1 c  Salt
      1    Red pepper pod
 
  Put 1/2 cup lime in about 1 gallon of boiling water and scald
  quickly, and pull off hair while hot.  Scrape well--remove feet,
  tail, and entrails--like you would a pig.  Cut off ears, remove eyes
  and head if desired.  Pour hot water over it and clean thoroughly.
  
  Put one cup salt in sufficient cold water to cover possum, add 1 pod
  red pepper and let stand overnight.  In the morning remove salt water
  and pour boiling water over it.  Cook in enough boiling water to boil
  up over possum but not enough to cover.  Cook until skin can be
  pierced with a fork easily, and let stand in water until ready for
  baking.
  
  When ready to bake, place possum in pan with skin side up.  Bake in a
  moderate oven until crisp and brown.  If fire is too hot, skin will
  blister and burn.
  
  Carve possum and surround with potatoes (sliced or quartered) which
  have been previously baked.

      Title: ALMOND & HONEY CAKES
 Categories: Cakes, Candies
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    250 g  Sweet flan pastry
           Butter; for the tart tin
           Flour; for the tart tin
     20 g  Apricot jelly; for glazing

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    125 g  Sugar
    125 g  Slivered almonds
     90 g  Unsalted butter
     35 g  Honey
      2 tb Double cream
     50 g  Crystallised fruits
           -- chopped
           Kirsch
 
  (Units: 100 g = 3 1/2 oz; 1 dl = 3 1/2 fl oz = 2/5 cup; 180 oC = 350
  oF; 200 oC = 400 oF; 230 oC = 450 oF; 250 oC = 475 oF; 2.5 cm = 1
  inch)
  
  Preparation:
  
  Pre-heat the oven to 200 oC. Butter and flour a tart tin with a
  removable base 22 cm in diameter.
  
  Roll out the pastry to fit the tart tin. Line the tin with the pastry
  and prick the bottom all over with a fork. Bake it for 10 minutes at
  the bottom of the pre-heated oven. Leave the pastry shell in the tin.
  
  Cooking:
  
  Lightly brush a thin layer of apricot glaze over the bottom of the
  pastry shell.
  
  Put all the remaining ingredients for the filling into a saucepan and
  heat them gently, stirring to mix them well as they melt.
  
  Raise the oven to 210 oC. When the filling is melted, spread it in a
  thin layer on the glazed pastry shell.
  
  Cook it for about 15 minutes: it is ready when the filling begins to
  bubble.
  
  Leave the cake to cool in its tin, then take it out.
  
  Serving:
  
  Cut the cake into little triangles or rectangular pieces. Serve them
  with coffee, like 'petits fours'.

 Categories: Breads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Whole almonds, with skins
  1 1/2 c  Brown rice flour
      4 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
      3 ts Poppy seeds
    1/2 c  Plain low-fat yogurt
    1/2 c  Water
      1 lg Whole egg
      1 lg Egg white white
      2 tb Vegetable oil
 
  This and the following two recipes are wheat free, utilizing brown
  rice flour.  They're from an article by Jacqueline Mallorca in the
  Chron. For those to whom it is important, she's working on a book
  about wheat-free baking.  No hint as to the release date though.
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.  Butter an 8 x 4inch loaf pan.
  
  Place almonds and 1/2 cup of the flour in bowl of a food processor and
  grind until a fine meal is formed++the flour will prevent the nuts
  from turning oily. Add remaining rice flour, the baking powder, salt
  and 2 teaspoons of the poppy seeds; process briefly.
  
  Combine yogurt, water, whole egg, egg white and oil in a 2-cup
  measuring cup.
  
  With processor motor running, pour liquid ingredients through feed
  tube over flour mixture, processing just long enough to mix.
  
  Transfer batter to prepared pan.  Sprinkle with remaining poppy
  seeds, and bake for 55 minutes.  Turn out onto a rack to cool. (Bread
  slices best after several hours, or the next day).
  
  Makes one 18-ounce loaf (18 slices).

      Title: ALMOND BISCOTTI
 Categories: Desserts, Cookies
      Yield: 30 Cookies
 
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Butter, sweet; melted
      3 tb Brandy
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 ts Almond extract
      1 c  Almonds, unsalted; chopped
      3    Eggs
  2 1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 tb Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  Preheat oven to 350~.  Mix sugar with butter, brandy, vanilla, almond
  extract, nuts and eggs.  Mix well. Stir in flour, baking powder and
  salt. Form into a long loaf (or loaves), place on a cookie sheet and
  bake for 20-30 minutes or until firm and softly cakelike. Remove from
  oven and let cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, slice into
  1/2 inch diagonal slices and return to cookie sheet. Bake for 15-25
  miutes, turning once, until both sides are brown-flecked and toasted.
  Cool thoroughly and store in an airtight jar. Makes 2-3 dozen.
  Variation 1 (Mandlebrot): increase sugar to 1-1/4 cups. Diced dried
  apricots may by added. Variation 2: for a clasic anise-flavored
  biscotto, substitute Pernod, Ouzo or Anisette for the brandy and omit
  the almond extract. Several tablespoons of anise seeds may be added
  for additional oomph. Variation 3 (Hazelnut biscotti): use hazelnuts
  in place of almonds. A hazelnut liqueur may be used instead of
  brandy.  Omit the almond extract. Variation 4 (Mediterranean
  biscotti): use rosewater instead of brandy. Substitute unsalted
  pistachio nuts for the almonds, and add 1/4 - 1/2 cup diced figs to
  the dough. Variation 5 (Ginger-flavored biscotti): to the basic
  dough, add 1 Tbsp powdered ginger, a generous dash of cloves and
  cinnamon, 1 or 2 Tbsp of candied ginger and 1/4 cup raisins, if
  desired.  Omit the almond extract. Variation 6 (Paximatha): this
  Greek rusk dates back to the 5th century, virtually unchanged.
  Substiture 1/2 to 3/4 cup toasted sesame seeds for the almonds. Omit
  the almond extact and flavor the dough with 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2
  tsp cloves. Variation 7 (Fekkas):  a Moroccon twice-baked cookie.
  Substitute orange flower water for the brandy. Variation 8; Pine nuts
  may be used instead of almonds, though the richness may be less
  desirable than the crunch of the toasted almonds. Candied fruits,
  too, may be added, 1/4 to 1/2 cup assorted fruits blended into the
  dough before baking. Variation 9 (Chocolate Dipped): melt 1/2 pound
  semi-sweet chocolate in the top of a double boiler over just
  simmering water. If it "seizes" or "tightens", add 2 Tbsp of unsalted
  buter and it should smooth out again. Dip only one side of each
  cookie (the chocolate won't seal in the moisture that way).

   Unless the instructions that came with your ABM  call for putting the
  yeast in the pan first and incorporating the liquid ingredients last,
  pour the milk into the baking pan of your ABM and break in the egg.
  If the butter is not soft, cut it into small chunks to ensure its
  blending into the dough, then add it to the liquids.
  
   Next add the almond paste, slicced so it will blend better too.
  Measure in the flour, brown sugar, and salt, and add the yeast as
  directed for your bread maker.
  
   You can use your machine's full cycle with this bread, but the quick
  cycle is better. If a light color setting is available, use it as
  well.
  
   As soon as the bread has finished baking, remove it from the machine,
  closing the cover again, and ease the loaf from the pan. Combine the
  corn syrup and warm water and brush the top of the loaf with this
  mixture, using a pastry brush. Sprinkle the slivered almonds over the
  glaze, put the bread gently back in its pan, and return it to the
  electronic oven for a few minutes to dry the glaze a bit. FROM THE

  Use two cups of blanched whole almonds. If only unblanched almonds are
  available, blanch them this way: Place the almonds in a saucepan and
  cover with water. Bring to boiling, then drain. The skins should slip
  off easily when you press each almond between your thumb and
  forefinger. Dry on paper towels. Spread the dry almonds in a shallow
  baking pan and toast in a 300 degree oven for about 20 minutes or
  until golden. Cool for 5 minutes before processing or blending.
  
  To process: Place the steel blade in your food processor or blender.
  Add the nuts. Cover and process or blend until a butter forms,
  stopping occasionally to scrape the sides of the bowl or blender a
  few times. Keep processing for three to five minutes or until all of
  the mixture is evenly blended. Process about two minutes more or
  until the butter is the desired smoothness.Store in a covered
  container in your refrigerator for up to two weeks. Bring to room
  temperature for easier spreading. Makes about 1 1/4 cups.

      3 lg Egg whites
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Flour
    1/2 c  Almonds, sliced, toasted
 
       Put the egg whites in a bowl and beat them briefly.
  
       Add the sugar and flour, then whisk.  Stir in the almonds.
  
       Butter a sheet pan and spoon tablespoons of mixture onto the pan.
  Spread the spoonfuls on the sheet slightly with the back of a spoon
  to form circles about 2 inches apart.
  
       Bake in a 350 F oven for 5 - 7 minutes.  Remove from oven and
  while still hot, you can mold the cookies into small cups by placing
  them over small cups, or shot glasses, or even the back of a muffin
  tin. Set aside to dry.
  
       When dry, the almond cookies can be eaten as is, or in my
  favorite way which is to fill them with mousse of some kind - or even
  ice cream or yogurt (if you eat hurriedly before they soften.) ;-)

      1 c  Evaporated milk
    1/3 c  Sugar
      1 tb Almond extract
      2 c  Hot water
      1 c  Mandarin oranges

  unlike a typical gelatin dessert - Jello it is not. Have large cooled
  bowl or (preferably) 9" x 9" glass dish ready for gelatin mixture.
  Add agar-agar to boiling water and stir until thoroughly dissolved.
  (Watch for burning on bottom.) At this stage, agar-agar will impart
  noticeable odor, but it does not carry through to finished dish. Add
  evaporated milk and sugar; bring back to boil and boil for 1 minute,
  stirring constantly. Add almond extract.  Slowly add hot water,
  continuing to stir until sugar is completely dissolved.  As soon as
  mixture returns to boil, turn off heat. Pour mixture into bowl for
  setting. When it has cooled slightly, cover and refrigerate for at
  least 2 hours.  Turn jellied mixture out onto flat plate, then cut it
  in 1" squares. Place squares in individ- ual serving bowls with
  Mandarin orange wedges and their juice. Cover and return to
  refrigerator until ready to serve.

      Title: ALMOND KRUMKAKES
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Sifted powdered sugar
      3 ea Unbeaten egg whites
      2 tb Ground almonds
    1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  Cream together butter and powdered sugar; beat well. Add by degrees
  egg whites, almonds, flour and vanilla. This version can also be used
  to make Chinese fortune cookies. COOKING INSTRUCTIONS:
    You will need a krumkake iron, which fits over a 7-inch burner
  surface (gas or electric).  Always use moderate heat.
    For each baking period, the iron should be lightly rubbed at the
  beginning with unsalted butter, but after this initial greasing,
  nothing more is required. The batter needs a preliminary testing, as
  it is quite variable, depending on the condition of the flour, so do
  NOT add at once all the flour called for in the recipe. Test the
  batter for consistency by baking 1 teaspoonful first. The iron is
  geared to use 1 tablespoon of batter for each wafer, and it should
  spread easily over the whole surface but should not run over when
  pressed down. If the batter is too thin, add more flour.  Should any
  batter drip over, lift the iron off its frame and cut off the excess
  batter with a knife run along the edge of the iron.
    Cook each wafer about 2 minutes on each side or until barely
  colored. As soon as you remove it from the iron, roll it on a wooden
  spoon handle or cone form, and, when cool, fill it.

      Title: ALMOND LACE ROLLS
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Unblanched almonds,*
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 tb (rounded) flour
      1 tb Heavy cream
      1 tb Milk
 
  * finely ground
  
   These cookies require precision timing and fast action but the
  results are worth the trouble. I make them for holidays and special
  occasions, but they are delicious anytime.
  
   Preheat oven to 350ø. Butter and flour baking sheet.
  
   In a small, heavy pan, place all ingredients. Cook over low heat,
  stirring constantly until butter melts. Drop by teaspoonful: onto
  baking sheet (do not bake more than six at one time).
  
   Bake at 350ø for 7-9 minutes. Cookies should be only slightly brown
  and still bubbling at the center. Let cool only for a minute or so
  until the edge is firm enough to lift with a thin spatula Then,
  working quickly, lift cookies and turn them top side down onto paper
  towels. Roll over the handle of a wooden spoon to get a cylinder
  shape and let cool until crisp.
  
   Use a fresh cookie sheet for each baking to avoid cookies sticking on
  sheet. If cookies get too firm to roll over the spoon handle, place
  back in the oven for a few moments.
  
   Store cookies in an airtight cookie jar or tin. They will keep for a
  long time, and can be made well ahead of the holiday season.
  
   Variations: These cookies also can be left flat-make them smaller if
  you do that; however, they don't have the flair of the rolled lacy
  effect. Or roll ends of cooled cookies in melted chocolate.

      Title: ALMOND NOUGAT
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Light corn syrup
      2 c  Sugar

    1/2 ts Almond extract
           Red or green food coloring

      1 c  Toasted chopped almonds
    1/4 c  Chopped candied cherries
 
  DIRECTIONS: Mix first 4 ingredients in heavy saucepan. Cook, stirring,
  until sugar is dissolved. Cook, without stirring, until a small
  amount of the mixture dropped in cold water forms a hard ball
  (250-F). Beat egg whites until stiff, but not dry, in large bowl of
  electric mixer. Gradually beat in about one fourth (not more) of the
  syrup, and continue beating until mixture holds its shape. Cook
  remaining syrup until a small amount of mixture separates into hard
  and brittle threads when dropped in cold water (300-F). Gradually
  beat into first mixture, and continue beating until the mixture
  begins to hold its shape. Add flavoring and food coloring to tint a
  delicate shade. Beat in butter; continue beating until very thick and
  satiny. Stir in nuts and cherries. Press into a buttered 8x8x2" pan,
  smoothing top. Let stand until firm. Turn out of pan, and cut in 1
  1/2" by 1" pieces. Wrap each piece individually in waxed paper. For
  best flavor, store several days in a cool place before serving.

  blender or food processor, grind almonds (makes 1 1/2 cups).
   2. In a heavy, 3-quart saucepan, combine granulated sugar, brown
  sugar, honey and water. Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until
  sugar is dissolved.
   3. Cook, uncovered and without stirring, to 300F on candy
  thermometer, or until a few drops of syrup in cold water form hard,
  brittle threads.
   4. Remove from heat; add butter and ground almonds.
   5. Pour into prepared cookie sheet. Using the 2 lemon halves and
  working quickly, smooth out and push from the center to the edge of
  the cookie sheet until the brittle is 1/8" thick.
   6. Lift brittle off the sheet before it is completely cooled and
  hardened, and mold it against the inside of prepared mold.
   7. Cool completely - about 2 hours. Unmold just before it is to be
  served.
   8. To unmold: With spatula, carefully loosen candy from pan; remove.
  Makes 1 large bell.
   Note: Leftover pieces can be kept in a closed jar at room
  temperature, or wrapped in aluminum foil.

           -chopped almonds on some
           -batches)
    3/4 c  Brown sugar (packed)
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine (butter
           -makes it richer)
    1/2 pk (6 oz size) semisweet
           -chocolate chips. (1/2 cup)
 
  Almond Rocca: This is not for Almond Roca, yet it is close enough and
  it is real easy. In fact my 14 year old daughter has been making it
  by herself at christmas for the past 4 years. Hope this will meet
  your needs. It comes from the Betty Crocker cookbook, so you may have
  it on hand already.
  
  Toffee: Butter square pan, 9x9x2 inches. Spread chopped nuts in pan.
  Heat sugar and butter to boiling, stirring constantly. Boil over
  medium heat, stirring constantly, 7 minutes (watch it real close the
  last minute or two).  Immediately spread mixture evenly over nuts in
  pan. Sprinkle chocolate pieces over hot mixture; place a baking sheet
  over pan so contained heat will melt chocolate. Spread melted
  chocolate over canndy. While hot, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares. chill
  until firm.
  
  Now for the changes we use.
  
  When we are going to be giving this as a gift, we melt another 1/2
  cup of chocolate in the microwave.  Use an 7x7x2 pan (or smaller than
  the 9x9x2). Spread the melted chocolate on top of the buttered pan
  that is covered with the nuts.  After the chocolate is spread on top,
  sprinkle more nuts on top, while chocolate is still warm. Then cut
  into small sizes. After the candy is set, remove from the pan and
  wrap individually with desert foil. I get mine at the bakery supply,
  or a craft shop.

  F.&R.Dahl: "This delicate soup, popular 100 years ago, is now
  unusual. On no account should it be liquidized at any stage, as that
  ruins the texture"
  
  Mince the almonds and, using a pestle and mortar, reduce to a paste
  with the egg yolks and a little stock, to stop them oiling.
  
  Bring the stock up to simmering point in a saucepan and whisk in the
  beurre manie. When that has dissolved, whisk in the almond paste.
  
  Cook gently for 30 minutes.
  
  Strain through a sieve, add the cream, season with salt and pepper,
  heat gently and serve.

  beating only until the mixture is smooth. Gently mix in the almonds.
  
   Spread out two pieces of wax paper. place large spoonfuls of the
  dough lengthwise on each piece of paper to form heavy strips about
  10-11 inches long. Fold the long sides of the paper p against the
  dough and, pressing against the paper with your hands, shape each
  strip of dough into a smooth oblong 12 inches long, 3 inches wide,
  and about 1 inch thick. Wrap the dough in the wax paper.
  
   Slide a cookie sheet under both packages of dough and transfer them
  to the freezer or refrigerator for several hours or overnight. This
  slices best when dough is frozen solid.
  
   Preheat oven to 375ø. Unwrap one roll of dough at a time. Place
  dough on a cutting board. With a very sharp knife cut the dough into
  1/4-inch slices and place them 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart on an
  ungreased cookie sheet.
  
   Bake the cookies for about 10-12 minutes at 375ø. The cookies are
  done when they are slightly colored and spring back when lightly
  pressed with a fingertip.

      4 oz (1/2 cup) ground almonds
      2 tb (2 1/2 T) ground rice
    1/2 pt (1 1/4 cup) milk
      2 tb (2 1/2 T) sugar
      1 ts Gelatin
 
  Here are a couple of recipes for almond pudding. There are lots of
  variations of this dish some using dairy products, some using gelatin
  and some using agar agar and some combining them. It IS good! This
  first one is more "from scratch".  The second uses almond extract.
  
  Mix the almonds and rice in a bowl with 2 pints (5 cups) cold water,
  cover and leave for 2 hours.  Strain through a fine muslin into a
  large bowl. Add milk and mix well.
  
  Stand the bowl in a large saucepan with enough boiling water to come
  halfway up the sides of the bowl.  Cover and simmer for 2 hours,
  stirring occasionally.
  
  Add the sugar, stir well and leave to cool slightly. Mix the gelatin
  with 2 tablespoons (2 1/2 T) hot water until dissolved. Stir into the
  milk mixture when almost cold. Mix well and pour into a shallow
  serving dish. Leave until set.

  sticky. If the dough is too soft, add more flour. With floured hands,
  divide the dough into two logs approximately 1 1/2 inches wide.
  Arrange the logs on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 20 to 25
  minutes or until they are lightly brown and firm to the touch. Remove
  from the oven and set the baking sheet on a rack for 10 minutes. On a
  cutting board, cut the logs on a diagonal into slices 1/2 inch wide.
  Return the slices to the baking sheet and bake for 5 to 7 minutes on
  each side or until the biscotti are very lightly browned and crisp.
  Cool on racks and store in airtight containers.
  
  Yield: About 36 biscotti

 Categories: Vegetarian, Try it
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Almonds, blanched
    1/4 c  Soy milk
      1 ts Nutritional yeast
    1/4 ts Garlic powder
    1/4 ts Seasoned salt
    1/4 c  Soy milk
  1 1/4 c  Oil, sunflower
      3 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 ts Cider vinegar
 
   Water can be substituted for soy milk.
   Process almonds to fine powder in blender or food processor. Add soy
  milk, yeast, garlic powder, and salt. Blend well, then add remaining
  soy milk to form smooth cream.
   With blender running on low, remove insert in top and drizzle in oil
  in thin stream until mixture is thick. Keep blender running and add
  lemon juice and vinegar. Blend on low for 1 minute longer, to allow
  mixture to thicken to desired consistency.
   Refrigerate tightly sealed; this will keep 10-14 days in
  refrigerator.
   Yields 1-1/2 to 2 cups Note: Do not be discouraged if, on occasion,
  your Almonnaise does not thicken to your expectations. Homemade
  mayonnaise products are among the most sensitive to prepare, and
  sometimes they just don't respond.  This recipe has been made
  successfully by many people, but once in a while it fails even for me
  [the author of The American Vegetarian Cookbook].  For every failure,
  however, I've had hundreds of successes that make it worth the small
  risk.

      Title: ALMOST NON-FAT BANANA BREAD MUFFINS <T>
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------MIX TOGETHER-----------------------------
    1/4 c  Unsweetened applesauce
      2 tb Lite preserves or
           Fruit-based jam

MMMMM--------------------------BEAT IN-------------------------------
      1    Egg replacer equal to 1 egg
           (reconstituted to liquid)

MMMMM--------------------------STIR IN-------------------------------
      2    To 3 mashed very ripe
           Bananas
      3 tb Soy milk
      2 ts White vinegar

MMMMM-----------------------SIFT TOGETHER----------------------------
      2 c  Whole wheat flour
      2 ts Wheat gluten
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      1 pn Salt
 
  Add dry ingredients to the batter, mixing well.  Stir in 1/4 C
  raisins or date pieces (found in the bulk bins at some health food
  stores). Fill cupcake size muffin tins 3/4 full. (Batter is very
  thick.) Bake 30 minutes at 350 degrees, until top is brown and has a
  hard crust. Cool slightly, then remove from tins. Makes 12. This is a
  great recipe to double or triple, depending on how many ripe bananas
  you have.
  
  These freeze beautifully and can be popped in the oven or toaster
  oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes to give them that fresh
  baked feel, if desired.
  
  I use a nonstick muffin pan but I just picked up some cushionaire
  muffin tins and find the breads came out lighter now. I do NOT spray
  the tins with any Pam.

      Title: ALMOST PERFECT CHEESECAKE
 Categories: Desserts, Dairy, Cheesecakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------

MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
      1    Box vanilla wafers
      1    Stick butter

MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
 
  Crush  wafers in food processor or blender until finely ground. Melt
  butter and mix with wafers for crust. Press into a 10 inch springform
  pan with your fingers, take care to make the crust as thin as
  possible with special attention to the corners where the crust tends
  to be a bit thick. Filling: Ingredients: 3 large pkg. cream cheese
  3/4 cup sugar juice of one large lemon             3 grade A large
  eggs Directions: Blend thoroughly the cream cheese, sugar and lemon
  juice. Mix until smooth . Add eggs and blend well.  Pour mixture into
  crust and bake for 30 to 45 minutes at 350 degrees. When done the
  cake will be set (not solid), slightly golden, and perhaps split on
  top. It is better slightly over and not under done. Remove from the
  oven and cool on a rack. It will firm up more on cooling. This is an
  important step...cool for about 45 minutes. Topping: Ingredients: 3
  cups sour cream 3/4 cup sugar 2 tsp vanilla Directions: Mix sour
  cream, 3/4 cup sugar and vanilla.  Pour on top of cooled cake. Return
  to 350 degree oven for 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
  Refrigerate and cool thoroughly (overnight is fine) but at least 5-6
  hours). Freezes well. You may serve now if you do not care for a
  glaze or for a killer bodiller glaze.... Glaze: Ingredients: 1 can (1
  lb) sour pitted cherries (packed in water) 1/2 cup sugar 1 tbs
  cornstarch 1 tbs lemon juice 2 drops red food coloring Directions:
  Drain cherries, reserving 1/2 cup liquid. Put aside cherries. In a
  saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch. Add cherry liquid, stir until
  smooth. Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil 1 minute..until
  thick and clear. Remove from heat, let cool slightly. Add lemon
  juice, cherries, food coloring. Cool until still warm but pourable.
  Pour on top on chilled cheese cake. Refrigerate for an hour or
  so.....While the cake may be prepared a day before, do not glaze
  until the day that you plan to serve. I have also used commercially
  prepared pie fillings as a glaze with good results.

 Categories: Breads, Breakfast, Easy, Quick, Quick & eas
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      1 tb Cornmeal, optional
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking soda
      2 ts Cream of tartar
      1 lg Egg, separated
    3/4 c  Milk, scant
      2 tb Unsalted butter, melted
 
  Heat waffle iron. Whisk dry ingredients together in a medium bowl.
  Whisk yolk with milk and butter. Beat egg white until it just holds a
  2-inch peak. Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients in a thin
  steady stream while gently mixing with a rubber spatula; be careful
  not to add liquid faster than you can incorporate it. Toward end of
  mixing, use a folding motion to incorporate ingredients; gently fold
  egg white into batter. Spread appropriate amount of batter onto
  waffle iron. Following manufacturer's instructions, cook waffle until
  golden brown, 2 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately. (You can keep
  waffles warm on a wire rack in a 200-degree oven for up to 5
  minutes.) Makes 3 to 4 waffles. NOTES : "If you're out of buttermilk,
  try this sweet-milk variation. By making your own baking powder using
  baking soda and cream of tartar and by cutting back on the quantity
  of milk, you can make a thick, quite respectable batter. The result
  is a waffle with a crisp crust and a moist interior." -- Christopher

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 c  Cherries, sour; fresh, ripe,
           ;pitted (about 2 pounds)
      6 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Olive oil

           ;with a mortar and pestle or
           ;the back of a spoon, and
           ;dissolved in 1 tablespoon
           ;warm water

MMMMM----------------SILVER XPRESS MAIL SYSTEM 5---------------------
 
    Combine the cherries and sugar in a 2 to 3 quart saucepan, and,
  stirring gently, bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to
  low and simmer uncovered for 2 or 3 minutes, or until the cherries
  have softened somewhat and given off most of their liquid. Remove
  from the heat.
    In a heavy 3 to 4 quart casserole, heat the olive oil over moderate
  heat until a light haze forms above it. Pat the chicken completely
  dry with paper towels and sprinkle it inside and out with salt. Brown
  the chicken in the hot oil, turning it frequently with a large spoon
  or tongs and regulating the heat so that the bird colors quickly and
  deeply without burning.
    Place the chicken on a plate and add the onion slices to the oil
  remaining in the casserole. Stirring frequently, cook for about 10
  minutes, or until the slices are richly browned. Return the chicken
  and all of the juices which have accumulated on the plate to the
  casserole, add the « cup of water and bring to a boil over high heat.
  Reduce the heat to low, cover tightly and simmer for about 30
  minutes, or until the chicken is tender.
    Transfer the chicken to a plate, set aside 2 tablespoons of the
  cooking liquid and discard the onion slices. When the bird is cool
  enough to handle, cut it into 6 or 8 serving pieces.
    Meanwhile, bring 6 cups of water to a boil in a heavy 4 to 5 quart
  casserole with a tightly fitting lid. Pour in the rice in a slow, thin
  stream so the water does not stop boiling. Stir once or twice, boil
  briskly for 5 minutes, then drain the rice in a sieve.
    Pour the reserved chicken cooking liquid and 4 tablespoons of the
  melted butter into the casserole and stir them together. Add half of
  the rice and, with a spatula or spoon, smooth it to the edges of the
  casserole. Cook uncovered over moderate heat for 5 minutes, then
  remove the casserole from the heat and add the chicken and half of
  the reserved cherries. Spread the remaining rice on top and pour in
  all the remaining cherries and their cooking liquid.  Cover tightly
  and cook over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the rice is
  tender.
    To serve, spoon about a cup of the rice into a small bowl, add the
  remaining 4 tablespoons of melted butter and the dissolved saffron
  and stir until the mixture is bright yellow. Place a layer of rice on
  a heated platter.  Arrange the chicken on top of it, cover the
  chicken with the remaining rice and cherry mixture. Sprinkle the
  saffron rice on top. With a metal spatula, lift the rice crust from
  the bottom of the casserole and arrange small pieces of it around the
  edge of the platter.

      4 lg Carrots (1 lb) chopped
      3 c  Broth chicken, beef, or
           Vegetable
      3 lb Potatoes (about 6large)
      1 lb (2 medium) rutabagas
    1/2 c  Minced fresh parsley
      1 ea Nutmeg to taste
    3/4 c  Jarlsberg cheese (I used ff
           Cheese instead)
 
  In a 5-6 quart pan (I used a small roaster) cook onions and carrots
  in 1/2 cup of broth until softened. Add to this the parsley.
  
  Peel and thinly slice the potatoes and rutabagas. Arrange half of the
  potato/rutabaga combo in the bottom of the pan (I sprayed with Pam
  first). Top with half the onion/carrot mixture. Repeat with the other
  half of the ingredients.  Over the top, pour the rest of the broth.
  
  Cover and bake for 1 1/2 hours in a 425 degree oven. Top with cheese
  and sprinkle with nutmeg.  Broil until cheese is browned.
  
  Makes 10-12 servings
  
  Comment: I wanted to share a recipe which I have been making this
  winter for my family.  It is a good cold weather dish. It makes
  enough for a crowd ~ my family (2 adults and 3 teens) only eat about
  half. This can be made ahead and chilled until ready to use.

      Title: BUTTERMILK-APRICOT SCONES
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------DRY INGREDIENTS---------------------------
      2 c  Flour
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 tb Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt

MMMMM---------------------MOIST INGREDIENTS--------------------------
    1/4 c  Margarine or butter, chilled
           -and cut into small pieces
    1/3 c  Chopped dried apricots
    1/4 c  Buttermilk or yogurt
    1/4 c  Apricot nectar
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
 
  Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl; cut in margarine with a pastry
  blender (or two forks) until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add
  the apricots and toss well, making sure each piece is well coated in
  flour and not clumped up with other apricot pieces. Make a well in
  the center of the mixture.  Combine buttermilk, apricot nectar, and
  egg; add to the well and mix with dry ingredients, until dry
  ingredients are moistened (dough will be sticky).
  
  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, flour you hands, and
  kneaded 4-5 times or knead it while still in the bowl (not
  traditional, but it seems to work for me). Pat dough into a 9" circle
  on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray.  Cut dough into 8
  wedges. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15 minutes, or until golden.
  
  Serve warm.
  
  Each scone will be around 230 calories (30% from fat) more or less,
  depending on the fat content of the buttermilk. I find yogurt works
  as well as buttermilk in the recipe. You could also brush the top of
  the scones with a little beaten egg white and sprinkle with sugar
  before backing, for a little extra sweetness.

  NOTES:
  
  *  Butternut squash and carrot casserole -- A delicious Thanksgiving
  or Christmas casserole.  My mother makes this at the holidays. I
  don't know where she originally got the recipe. Yield: Serves 10.
  
  *  Cinnamon sugar is a mixture of sugar and powdered cinnamon.
  Commercial cinnamon sugar mixtures are mostly sugar. My mom prepares
  her own mixture with the emphasis decidedly on the cinnamon.

      Title: BUTTERSCOTCH BANANA PIE BAYONA *JB
 Categories: Desserts, Pies
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
  1 1/4 c  Milk
      2 lg Egg yolks
      1 lg Whole egg
      3 tb Cornstarch
      3 tb Firmly packed brown sugar
      2 tb Unsalted butter, softened
  1 1/2 ts Unflavored gelatin
      3 tb Cold water
    2/3 c  Granulated sugar
  1 1/3 c  Heavy cream
      2 ts Vanilla
      2 tb Scotch  (up to 3)
    1/4 ts Salt
      3    Firm-ripe bananas

MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    3/4    Stick (6 tablespoons) cold
           -unsalted butter, cut into
           -bits
      2 tb Cold vegetable shortening
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Ice water  (up to 4)
 
  Make pastry dough: In a bowl with a pastry blender or in a food
  processor blend or pulse together flour, butter, shortening, and salt
  until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 2 tablespoons ice water and
  toss with a fork or pulse until water is incorporated. Add enough
  remaining ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing or pulsing to
  incorporate, until mixture begins to form a dough. On a work surface
  smear dough in 3 or 4 forward motions with heel of hand to slightly
  develop gluten in flour and make dough easier to work with. Form
  dough into a ball and flatten to form a disk. Chill dough, wrapped in
  plastic wrap, 1 hour. Makes enough dough for a single-crust 9- to
  10-inch pie.
  
  Make pie: On a lightly floured surface roll out dough into an 11-inch
  round (about 1/8 inch thick) and fit into a 9-inch (1-quart) metal
  pie plate, crimping edge decoratively. Prick shell all over with a
  fork and chill 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375°F. Line shell with
  foil and fill with pie weights or beans. Bake shell in middle of oven
  15 minutes. Carefully remove foil and pie weights or beans and bake
  shell 5 minutes more, or until pale golden. Cool shell on a rack. In
  a large heavy saucepan bring milk just to a boil and remove pan from
  heat. In a large heatproof bowl whisk together yolks, whole egg,
  cornstarch, and brown sugar until combined well. Gradually whisk in
  hot milk and pour mixture into pan. Cook mixture over moderately high
  heat, whisking constantly, until it just comes to a boil and is
  thickened. Remove pastry cream from heat and, scraping with a
  spatula, force through a fine sieve set over another large heatproof
  bowl. Whisk in butter until incorporated. In a very small saucepan
  sprinkle gelatin over water and let stand about 1 minute to soften.
  Heat gelatin mixture over low heat until gelatin is dissolved. Stir
  gelatin mixture into pastry cream and cool. In a dry heavy saucepan
  cook granulated sugar over moderate heat, without stirring, until it
  begins to melt. Continue cooking sugar, stirring with a fork, until
  melted and swirl pan until caramel is a deep golden. Remove pan from
  heat and carefully add 1/3 cup heavy cream down side of pan (caramel
  will bubble up and steam). Return pan to heat and simmer, stirring,
  until caramel is dissolved. Stir in vanilla, Scotch, and salt until
  combined and cool sauce. Stir sauce into pastry cream until combined
  well. In a bowl beat 1/2 cup remaining heavy cream until it just
  holds stiff peaks and fold into pastry cream. Cut 2 bananas into
  1/4-inch slices and fold into pastry cream. Pour filling into shell
  and chill, covered loosely, 4 hours or overnight. Beat remaining 1/2
  cup heavy cream until it just holds stiff peaks and spread on pie.
  Cut remaining banana into 1/4-inch slices and arrange decoratively on
  pie.

      4 oz Margarine
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    Egg, beaten
      8 oz Brown sugar

  Set oven to 350F or Mark 4. Grease a baking sheet. Melt the sugar,
  margarine and vanilla essence together in a saucepan very gently over
  a low heat. Remove from the heat. When the mixture has cooled add the
  beaten egg and mix together. Sift the flour and salt into a bowl.
  Make a well in the centre and pour in the cooled egg/fat/sugar
  mixture. Knead into a stiff dough. This will be fairly dry, but it
  needs no extra moisture. Roll out the dough on a floured surface into
  1/2 inch thickness and cut out the biscuits with a 2 inch biscuit
  cutter. Place on the baking sheet with sufficient space to allow them
  to spread. Bake for 20 minutes until light golden in colour.

      3    Eggs
      2 ts Vanilla
      2 c  Flour

    1/2 c  Butter
      3 c  Sifted confectioners sugar
      2 ts Instant coffee*
 
  * dissolved in 2 Tablespoons hot water
  
   These chewy squares ooze brown sugary butterscotch. They becrumb the
  lips and besmear the chin, like home-baked goodies should.
  
   Preheat oven to 350ø.
  
   Melt butter in a large saucepan. Add sugar and beat well to mix.
  Cool the mixture slightly, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.
  
   Sift together flour, salt and baking powder. Stir it into the wet
  ingredients, then add the nuts. Mix well. Spread brownies in a
  greased 11 x 7 x 2-inch pan and bake at 350ø for 30 to 35 minutes or
  until a light gold. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out.
  This is easiest if you up-end the pan over waxed paper, then turn the
  cake right side up. Let it finish cooling on a rack.
  
   To make the frosting, cream 1/2 cup butter with confectioners sugar.
  Beat it until light, then beat in the coffee mixture. Spread over the
  brownies. When frosting has set, cut in squares.

  NOTES:
  
  *  Rolled cookies for the Christmas holidays -- I almost never make
  these cookies except at Christmas time. They just seem to be
  Christmas cookies.
   (I did make a batch of heart shaped ones last Valentine's day for my
  then-fiance.)  I usually make these cookies in Christmas shapes and
  frost them with green and red frosting. This is a good recipe for
  kids to help out with.
  
  *  It helps to keep most of the dough in the refrigerator while you
  are cutting shapes.  It cuts much better when it is cold.
  
  *  These are time-consuming and fairly difficult, but worth it.

 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           -Crust -----------------
  1 1/2 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Packed Light-Brown Sugar
    1/2 c  Butter, Cut In 1/2 Inch Pcs
           -Topping ----------------
    1/4 c  Light Corn Syrup
      6 oz Butterscotch Pieces
        pn Salt
      2 tb Butter Or Margarine
      1 tb Water
      8 oz Walnuts, Chopped
           Medium-Fine
 
  CRUST: In bowl mix flour, salt and sugar. With pastry blender cut in
  butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Spread mixture evenly in
  greased 13 x 9x 2 inch pan, then with hand press firmly into smooth
  compact layer. Bak ein preheated 375 degree oven about 12 minutes or
  until lightly browned. Remove pan to rack while you prepare topping.
  TOPPING: Combine syrup, butterscotch pieces, salt, butter and water
  in large heavy saucepan. With rubber spatula stir over low heat,
  pressing butterscotch until melted and smooth. (A few tiny unmelted
  pieces of butterscotch are all right.) Quickly stir in walnuts and
  remove from heat. Working quickly to prevent mixture from hardening,
  place large spoonfuls on warm baked crust. With back of spoon spread
  mixture to within 1/2 to 3/4 inch of crust edges (during baking,
  topping will run toward edges). Bake in 375 degree oven 10 minutes.
  Cool in pan 30 to 40 minutes or until only slightly warm. With small
  sharp knife loosen around edges, then cut in 16 bars. (Bars in center
  of pan will appear too soft, but they will become firm as they cool;
  wait to remove them.) With wide metal spatula transfer bars to
  cutting board; cool thoroughly until firm. Cut each bar in half.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
    150 g  Rye flour
    850 g  Strong white flour
      3 c  Water
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Dry yeast
 
  ("Strong white" flour is the UK term for all-purpose flour.) Mix the
  yeast in 1/2 C of the water at blood heat, and leave 15 minutes to
  proof. Sift the mixed wheat and rye flours into a mixing bowl to
  warm. When the yeast has proofed, make a well in the flour, pour the
  yeast mixture in, and cover it over with a little flour. Leave for 20
  minutes to "set the sponge". When this time has elapsed, begin mixing
  (or kneading with the dough hook if using a mixer). Add 2 cups of the
  water, check for texture, and add the rest if necessary. Knead
  vigorously. If using a dough hook, somewhere about 10 minutes into
  the process the dough will suddenly change texture and require more
  flour. Add it (probably about another 150 g). Turn the dough into an
  oiled bowl to rise. The texture will be somewhat sticky. After
  allowing to rise for 1-1&1/2 hours, turn out of the bowl, punch down,
  and divide into two loaves. Turn into nonstick pans (or greased ones)
  and allow to rise for another hour. Bake at 220C for 35 minutes. Turn
  out of the pans and allow to sit in the still-hot oven upside down
  for 5 minutes to harden the crusts. Let sit overnight before cutting.

      Title: BYRON'S FAMOUS KILLER CHEESE DIP
 Categories: Dips, Party
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
     11 oz Cheese soup (one can
           -of condensed soup)
      4 oz Green chilies, chopped
           -(I use Old El Paso
           -canned chilies)
      1 md Yellow onion, chopped
      1 tb Red pepper, crushed
      2 tb Chili powder
      1 tb Cumin
      1    Garlic clove, crushed
    1/4 ts Hot sauce (Tabasco sauce
           -or hot pepper sauce)
      8 oz Sour cream
 
  Mix together all ingredients except the sour cream; heat to boiling
  at low heat.  When blended, correct seasoning (usually needs more
  cumin and garlic.) Add sour cream and heat until it bubbles slightly.
  Serve with Tostitos or any natural Mexican-style corn chip.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A hot spicy party cheese dip -- Here it is, folks! By popular
  demand, the cheese dip known to make women faint, strong men cry, and
  small children run for their mommies. This started out as an attempt
  to replicate a Chili con Queso dip, but took off in its own
  direction. Yield: makes 18 oz of dip.
  
  *  This recipe may be doubled, quadruped or even sextupled without
  problem. Go easy on the red pepper if your guests don't like hot
  food. The effect, if done correctly, should be an initial impression
  of cheese, cumin, sour cream and garlic followed a second later by a
  sinus-cleaning heat. As one partaker has put it "You have to keep
  eating because if you don't, you'll die." Guaranteed to increase beer
  consumption at parties.
  
  Good Luck!
  
  : Difficulty:  very easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes.
  : Precision:  Measure the spices, just so you'll know how much you
  have put in.

 Categories: Greek, Appetizers
      Yield: 60 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      1    Jar grapeleaves (or fresh)

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      2 tb Oil
      1 lb Ground beef or lamb
      2    Onions; chopped
      1    Garlic clove; pressed
      2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Tomato sauce
      1 c  Rice
      2 tb Chopped mint
      2 tb Chopped parsley
    1/2 ts Salt
           Pepper to taste
    1/8 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 c  Currants
    1/4 c  Port wine (optional)
    1/4 c  Pine nuts or walnuts
      2 c  Water
      1    Lemon (juice only)

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      3    Eggs
      2    Lemons (stained juice only)
      1 c  Hot broth
 
  If using canned grape leaves, rinse off brine by floating leaves in a
  basin of cold water.  Prepare fresh vine leaves by pouring a cup of
  boiling water over them in a bowl.  Drain.  Spread 5 or 6 leaves out
  at a time on a flat surface.  Lay leaf stem side up. Snip off stem
  with kitchen shears.
  
  MAKE FILLING:  Heat oil in large frying pan.  Fry meat, onions and
  garlic on medium heat for 5 minutes, mixing it as it cooks. Add water
  and remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil. Cover. Reduce heat to
  simmer and cook 10 minutes, until water is absorbed. Set aside until
  cool enough to handle.  Put 1 teaspoon of filling near stem. Bring
  left side of leaf towards center, then bring right side towards
  center. They will not always meet.  Pick up stem end of leaf, tucking
  in the filling. Roll away from you.  It will be an oblong roll like a
  sausage.
  
  Line the bottom of a large skillet with 4 leaves. Place each roll so
  that the tucked under end is on the bottom. Arrange each roll snugly,
  one next to the other, until all the leaves (except 3), and filling
  are gone. Place these leaves flat on top of rolls. Place a flat dish
  on top of rolls also to prevent their unravelling during cooking.
  
  Add water and lemon juice.  Bring to a boil.  Cover. Reduce heat to
  simmer and cook 45 minutes.  When done, remove pot from fire. Make
  Egg and Lemon Sauce and add to broth immediately or serve without
  sauce either cold as an appetizer or as a hot entree.
  
  EGG AND LEMON SAUCE: Beat eggs until thick and light yellow, at least
  5 minutes, with an electric beater or 10 to 15 minutes by hand. Add
  juice slowly, beating all the while. Mix 1 cup hot broth into beaten
  eggs, stirring it in quickly with spoon (or wire whisk) so heat will
  not curdle the eggs.  Cook over very low heat until thickened.

  This is a hearty sweet and sour meat soup that can be used as a main
  dish. Bubbies  measurements were never exact. You need to taste. Put
  meat and bones in a 8 or 12 qt stock pot. Put in cans of tomato,
  cover with water and bring to a boil. In the meantime, get your
  veggies ready. Slice beets and carrots, others go in whole. When
  stock boils, skim off top. Put in beets, carrots, garlic, and other
  veggies. Turn heat down to a simmer and keep lid on askew. After
  about an hour, put in garlic and sugar.
   I have used Sweet and Low. Amounts are a matter of preference. It
  should have a rich, sweet and sour taste. I break up the meat and
  stir it back into the soup before serving. NOTE: Sometimes I add some
  tomato paste; 2 or 3 T for body; Enjoy!!! * Elaine/Framingham *

           -(or less)
           Splash water or beer
           -(whatever you're
           -drinking)
 
  Cut the cabbage in half and soak in salted water for 15 minutes.
  Agitate and drain well. Shred the cabbage.
  
  Heat the bacon fat or butter in a large, heavy skillet and add the
  diced potatoes.  Cook over medium heat until lightly browned. Add 2
  chopped onions and cook until transparent, about 5 minutes.
  
  Add cabbage and toss well with two wooden spoons, a la stir-fry. When
  the cabbage starts to wilt, add salt and freshly-ground black pepper
  to taste and a splash of that beer in your left hand and about 1 T
  wine vinegar. Cover, with lid slightly askew, and simmer over low
  heat until tender (about 30-45 minutes).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cabbage and Potatoes -- With a nod toward Nancy Mintz who reminded
  me how good cabbage can be, especially in the winter time when other
  fresh veggies are scarce. This recipe serves 8, and is good hot or
  cold.
  
  *  Like Nancy said, one cabbage goes a loooonnnngggg way, so I
  usually use a quarter to a half a head when cooking for 2.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 45 minutes simmering.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: CABBAGE KIMCHEE
 Categories: Vegetarian, Ethnic, Relishes, Salsa
      Yield: 2 Quarts
 
      1 lb Chinese cabbage
      1 lb White radish
      3 tb Salt
      2 tb Finely minced fresh ginger
  1 1/2 tb Minced garlic
      5    Scallions, cut into fine
           -rounds, including green
      1 tb Cayenne
      1 ts Sugar
 
  If you are using a small, whole cabbage, cut it in half lengthwise,
  and then cut it across at 2-inch intervals. If you are using half of
  a large cabbage, cut it in half again lengthwise, and then crosswise
  at 2-inch intervals.
  
  Peel the white radish, cut it in half lengthwise, and then cut it
  crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices.  In a large bowl put 5 cups
  water and 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons of the salt. Mix. Add the
  cabbage and radish to this water and dunk them in a few times as they
  have a tendency to float.  Leave the vegetables in the salty water.
  Cover loosely and set aside for 12 hours. Turn the vegetables over a
  few times.
  
  Put the ginger, garlic, scallions, cayenne, sugar, and 1 teaspoon
  salt in another large bowl.  Mix well.
  
  Take the cabbage out of its soaking liquid with a slotted spoon (save
  the liquid) and put it in the bowl with the seasonings. Mix well.
  
  Put this cabbage mixture into a 2-quart jar or crock. Pour enough of
  the salt water over it to cover the vegetables (about 2 cups). Leave
  1 inch of empty space at the top of the jar. Cover loosely with a
  clean cloth and set aside for 3 to 7 days.  In the summer, kimchees
  mature with much greater speed;  in the winter, the process slows
  down unless the central heating is ferocious.  Taste the pickle after
  3 days to check on the sourness. When it is done to your liking,
  cover the jar and refrigerate.
  
  To serve, remove just as much of the kimchee solids as you think you
  will need for a meal--a cupful is enough for 4 people--and put it in
  the center of a bowl.  The kimchee liquid in this pickle is left
  behind in the jar and may be used to flavor stews and soups.  Serve
  this cabbage kimchee with any Korean meal.
  
  ~- Madhur Jaffrey, _World-of-the-East Vegetarian Cooking_
  
  (Be sure and keep a close eye on the kimchee after the third day. If
  mold appears, scoop out the mold, and refrigerate the kimchee
  immediately).

 Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian, Indian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Mung dal
    1/2 sm Cabbage; chopped fine
      1 lg Baking potato, diced
      1 bn Frozen peas
      1 ts Sambar powder
           Turmeric; to taste
           Salt; to taste
           Shredded dry coconut
           -soaked in a little water
           Mustard; (seasoning)
           Urad dal; (seasoning)
           Dry red chilli; (seasoning)
           Curry leaves; (seasoning)
           Oil; (seasoning)
 
  Set dal to cook in about 2 cups water and a touch turmeric. When dal
  is three-quarters done add shredded cabbage, potatoes and a little
  more water if needed on top of the dal. Add sambar powder and salt.
  
  Cover with a lid and let it simmer away another 10 to 15 minutes.
  Veggies should be done but still holding their shape. Stir in wet
  coconut. Remove from heat. Top with seasoning as explained in
  previous recipes.
  
  If more particular, grind fresh coconut with roasted red chilli and
  roasted urad dal paste in lieu of the desiccated coconut.
  
  Variations:
  
  You can do a keerai (spinach) kootan with a little modification. Add
  fresh coconut ground with roasted red chillies, urad dal and a little
  cumin. Also you can cook toovar dal separately or throw veggies + dal
  in a cooker for a few minutes, if you like. This tends to overcook
  veggies but can be done fast.

      Title: CABBAGE ROLLS (POLISH STYLE)
 Categories: Polish, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Ground Beef;lean
    1/2 c  Rice;uncooked
      1 md Onion;Diced
      1    Green Pepper;Diced
      2    Eggs
      1    Cabbage;large head
      2 qt Tomato Juice
 
  PREPARE THE CABBAGE LEAVES: The Old timers would freeze the head
  solid, then peel the leaves from the head as they thawed. The best
  way I've found is to 1)cut the core out with a knife, then put the
  hole-where-the-core- was, side down in a steamer over boiling water.
  Let it sit for about 10 minutes and remove. Several layers of the
  outer leaves should be soft enough to remove from the head. When
  you've removed as many as you can, return the head to the steamer to
  soften more leaves. Take a sharm knife and remove as much of the
  central vein as you can. FILLING: Mix all the other ingredients
  together in a bowl. work it with your hands until the eggs and other
  inredients except the tomato juice are thouroughly mixed into the
  meat. Now, take a glob of mixture and set it in the hollow of a
  deveined leaf,with the end that was near the core towards you. Fold
  the end nearest you about / way over the mix. Fold the left side over
  the mix and then the right side. Roll about / turn away from you so
  that the "seam" is on the bottom. Place in the pan seam side don and
  continue with the other leaves.* When you've made the last cabbage
  roll,pour in the tomato juice to cover. Bring to a boil then simmer
  for AT LEAST an hour. Serve in a bowl with the juice, although these,
  like spagetti are better the 2nd day.
  
  *This is an ideal cabbage roll. 3/4 of them won't go together this
  perfectly, so be ready to make adjustments when making the rolls.
  
  VARIATIONS: Garlic is great, paprika and chili powder will work in the
  stuffing, V-8 instead of tomato juice is pleasantly different.

      Title: CABRITO EN SANGRE (KID IN BLOOD)
 Categories: Mexico, Lamb/mutton
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1    Baby goat, or kid (lamb can
           -be used, but it is not as
           -good)
      3    Garlic cloves
     10    Comino seeds (cumin)
           Salt to taste
    1/4 ts Marjoram
      3    Carrots, sliced thin
    1/2 c  Lard
 
  A: Meat Ingredients
  
  When the young goat is killed, have the butcher drain off the blood
  and save it in a container. Wash the carcass, cut off the lower legs,
  tail, etc., and cut the kid into conveniently sized serving pieces,
  roughly about the size of a half chicken. Place the meat in a pot
  with garlic and salt. Cover with cold water and boil for one hour.
  Stretch a triple thickness of cheesecloth, or a tea towel, over the
  top of the pot. Pour in the blood, allowing the cloth to contain the
  congealed element. Draw the ends together, tie with a string, drop
  into the pot liquid, and boil for 10 minutes. Remove the cloth
  containing the congealed blood, and force the blood through a fine
  sieve or strainer. Remove the meat from the pot, drain, and brown in
  a large skillet in very hot lard. Add the mashed blood, comino seeds,
  marjoram and sliced carrots. Add 1/2 cup of the water in which the
  goat meat was cooked. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, and add
  the following ingredients to complete the sauce, as directed.
  
  B: Sauce ingredients:
  
  1/2 cup olive oil 3/4 cup white wine 10 whole peppercorns 2
  Tablespoons chili powder Tabasco to taste 1/2 teaspoon salt 10 whole
  cloves 4 bay leaves 1/4 teaspoon marjoram 2 garlic cloves 1
  Tablespoon sugar 2 Tablespoons vinegar 2 green chili peppers, cut in
  small pieces (a small green bell pepper can be substituted) 2 onions,
  finely chopped 1/2 cup Mexican (or unsweetened) chocolate, ground and
  made into a thick paste with water 2 Tablespoons flour, mixed with
  water to make a paste 1/4 cup pimientos, finely chopped
  
  Place olive oil, wine, peppercorns, chili powder, Tabasco, salt,
  cloves, bay leaves, marjoram, garlic, sugar, vinegar, chopped
  peppers, and chopped onions in a saucepan. Simmer over a low flame
  for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the chocolate paste,
  stirring constantly as the mixture boils for about 3 minutes. Add the
  flour paste and chopped pimientos, stirring until the ingredients
  thicken.
  
  C: Combination and serving:
  
  Add the sauce ingredients to the meat, blood and other contents of the
  skillet (You will have to use 2 or 3 skillets for this quantity) Stir
  well until all ingredients are thoroughly blended. This should take 2
  or 3 minutes. Serve on individual plates garnished with watercress,
  cubes of fresh pineapple, chilled seedless grapes, white radishes and
  string beans. Orange sections dipped in powdered sugar make a good
  addition. With this dish serve either tortillas or tostados, a green
  salad wit a simple oil and vinegar dressing, and beer, preferably a
  Mexican beer if you can get it.
  
  Serves 10-12

      2 md Tomatoes, coarsely chopped
      1 sm Onion, chopped

    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Dried oregano leaves
           Dash of pepper
 
  This is from "Betty Crocker's New International Cookbook". According
  to the recipe, "No salad is more characteristic of Mexico than Cactus
  Salad. Nopal, or prickly pear cactus paddles, are fleshy little
  wedges that are delicious tossed with a vinaigrette.  The dressing
  above features aromatic cilantro.
        Place cactus, tomatoes, onion and cilantro in glass or plastic
  bowl. Shake remaining ingredients in tightly covered jar. Pour over
  vegetables; toss. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours. Serve on
  lettuce leaves if desired.  6 servings.
  
  NOPALES:
  
        The recipe states, "These cacti are not so viciously spined as
  many others.  The paddles (leaves) are the edible portion, a great
  favorite in Mexican cooking. Called nopalitos, they are boiled and
  eaten crisp-tender, dressed in salads, or served tender and hot, as a
  cooked vegetable. Their little spines must be removed before cooking.
  Look in specialty stores featuring Mexican groceries for cans and
  fresh nopalitos." Walt

      1    Large garlic clove, sliced
      2 c  1/2-inch bread cubes
           - made from 2-day-old rolls
           - 4 lg slices French bread
           - or 1/3 baguette (the more

MMMMM---------------------------SALAD--------------------------------
      3    Heads romaine
           - or enough to yield 4 qts

    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese
           - freshly grated
           - OR Romano cheese
           - OR a combination
 
     Make dressing by whisking together vinegar, anchovy, if desired,
  mustard, minced garlic and pepper. Slowly whisk in 1 cup olive oil,
  drop by drop at first. When all the oil has been added, whisk in
  lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce.  If you omit the anchovy,
  season with salt, if desired.
     To prepare croutons, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and vegetable
  oil in skillet.  Saute sliced garlic until lightly browned, about 3
  minutes. Remove with slotted spoon. Add bread to oil and cook over

  of the lettuce.) Tear leaves into 2-inch pieces; rinse and thoroughly
  dry lettuce. Count on about 2 cups of torn leaves per person.
     To assemble salad, place torn romaine in a large bowl. Sprinkle

  cup cheese and toss again. Add dressing, toss well; serve at once.

      Title: CAESAR SALAD (CEIDEBURG)
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      5    Anchovies
      1 tb Cracked black peppercorns
           -(see Note)
    1/2 c  Extra virgin olive oil
    1/2 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
           -cheese
      1    Egg
      3 tb Red wine vinegar
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 tb Pureed garlic (see Note)
      2 ts Dry mustard
      1 ts Celery salt
      3 ds Tabasco
      3 ds Worcestershire sauce
    1/2    Loaf sourdough, hearty
           -French or Italian bread,
           -with crust, diced
           For croutons
      2 md Heads romaine lettuce
 
  Zesty Tabasco and Worcestershire spice up this innovation from "City
  Cuisine" by Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken (William Morrow and
  Co., 1989).  The dressing contains lightly cooked egg, so if made
  ahead must be refrigerated.
  
  Combine anchovies, black pepper and olive oil in a blender. Puree for
  about 5 minutes until very smooth. Add grated Parmesan. Measure and
  reserve 1/3 cup for use with croutons.
  
  Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil.  Place a refrigerated egg
  on slotted spoon and into boiling water. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes;
  remove and reserve.
  
  Place vinegar, lemon juice, mustard, celery salt, Tabasco and
  Worcestershire sauce in a large bowl and whisk in anchovy mixture.
  Crack open egg and spoon (including parts the are uncooked) into
  mixture. Whisk until well combined.  Refrigerate dressing if not
  using right away. Combine reserved anchovy mixture with diced bread
  in a bowl; toss to coat. Heat a dry cast-iron skillet or non-stick
  pan over medium-high and cook croutons, stirring constantly, until
  golden and crisp.
  
  Wash and dry lettuce and break into bite-sized pieces. Place in a
  salad bowl along with dressing and toss well. Add toasted croutons,
  toss again and serve.
  
  Makes 6 servings.
  
  NOTES: To crack peppercorns, place whole peppercorns on a work
  counter. Place the bottom of a heavy skillet or saucepan on top and
  push down and away from you.
  
  To puree garlic, place peeled garlic cloves in a blender with a dash
  of olive oil; puree.  Make in quantity, if desired, and store in the
  refrigerator as long as two weeks.

      Title: CAESAR SALAD~ "THE ORIGINAL RECIPE"
 Categories: Dressings, Salads
      Yield: 2 + servings
 
      5    Flat anchovies
      1    Head of romaine, cut into
           Strips and well chilled
      1 ts Dry mustard
      1 ts Garlic powder
    1/3 c  Olive oil
    1/8 c  Approximately, cider vinegar
           Worchestershire sauce
           Tabasco sauce
      2    Eggs, coddled
      1    Juice of lemon, or to taste
           Parmesan cheese
           Croutons
           Salt
           Fresh ground pepper
 
                               -MIKE'S KITCHEN-
  
  Many claims have been made regarding the recipes I've collected over
  the years. This one I can't help but believe: The following is the
  ORIGINAL Caesar Salad recipe, created on the spot from miscellaneous
  ingredients by Chef Caesar, in Tijuanna, in the 1920's! If this
  really isn't the original, it should be. It's that good. If the
  ingredients are balanced just right, the result is a rich, smooth,
  buttery-with-a-hint-of-lemon concoction that I have never yet found
  an equal to. The quantities of spices, etc., listed are at best close
  approximations. I estimated the measures because the salad needs to
  be mixed freehand at the table with as much (understated of course)
  fanfare as possible, and the various amounts are about what are used.
  A little experimentation should make perfect, and would be well worth
  the effort. This recipe is an instance where culinary artistry
  definitely comes into play.
  
  THE SALAD BOWL:
        Should be wooden with a rough, porous surface to "grab" the
  anchovy. Rather than being cut up in the salad, the anchovy is rubbed
  into the bowl. Though other kinds of bowls can be used--metal,
  ceramic, smooth wood--they neither pulverize the anchovy as well, nor
  do they hold the aroma.
  
  THE INGREDIENTS:
        Before hand, cut the romaine crosswise into eating-sized strips.
  Chill to crisp. When ready to serve the salad, place in the
  anchovy-seasoned bowl. In another smaller bowl, mix the garlic powder
  and dry mustard, and sprinkle over the romaine. Mix lightly to spread
  the seasonings. (As an alternative, flavor olive oil with garlic and
  use that in place of the the garlic powder and the regular olive oil
  the recipe calls for.) Add 4 - 5 dashes (approx.) of Worchestershire
  sauce and the same of Tabasco, depending on taste. Mix lightly again.
  Add the oil and vinegar.
        In yet another small bowl, thoroughly beat the coddled eggs
  with a small wire whip, and add to the romaine. Add lemon, salt, and
  fresh ground pepper, to taste. Though a little bit of vinegar is
  important to the recipe, lemon is the more primary of the two
  ingredients, and should be the one adjusted to taste. Add croutons
  and parmesan cheese in the amounts desired, and mix thoroughly.
        Serve on chilled dinner plates. Garnish with more croutons and
  parmesan to taste. Some of the croutons will be soaked with the
  dressing, while the ones used to garnish will add a crunchy texture.
  Also, garnish with crossed strips of anchovy, if desired.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----------------------
  2 1/2 ts Yeast
      2 c  Bread flour
      1 c  Whole wheat flour
  1 1/2    Garlic cloves, crushed
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
    1/2 tb Salt
    1/4 c  Parmesan, grated
      3 tb Olive oil
      4    Anchovies; chopped
    1/2 ts Lemon peel, grated
  1 1/2 c  Sourdough starter
    1/2 c  Water; warm
 
  Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
  order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
  push Start.
  
  In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.
  
  If Caesar made bread instead of salad dressing, this would be it.
  Sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes or tuna salad, or serve it with a
  green salad. For an hors d'oeuvre, toast slices and top with steak
  tartare or a sliver of rare roast beef. The crusty ends can be cut
  into croutons, toasted in a frying pan, and tossed in a salad.

 Categories: Relishes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6    To 12 fresh jalapenos,
           -stems removed
     12    Tomatillos, husks removed
    1/2    White onion, chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, chopped
    1/3 c  White wine vinegar
    2/3 c  Water
      2 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 bn Cilantro, chopped
           (about 1 cup)
 
  Combine all the ingredients except cilantro in a pot and bring to a
  boil. Cover, lover the heat, and simmer for about 10 minutes or until
  the tomatillos are soft. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.
  Transfer the cooled ingredients and the liquid to a blender.  Add the
  cilantro, and puree until smooth and uniformly green. Refrigerate.
  Makes about two cups. Serve cold or at room temperature. It's
  wonderful served with grilled meats....a pork chop, for example. It's
  also very nice mixed with some yogurt to toss with hot pasta for a
  low-fat quick dinner. And stir some into some soup; it will perk up
  almost anything without being overwhelming.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 tb BUTTER, SOFTENED
      2 ts MINCED GARLIC
      2 ts MINCED PARSLEY
      1 ea SHALLOT, MINCED

      1 ts PERNOD
      1 tb LEMON JUICE
      1 x  SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTE
 
       1. Whip all ingredients together. Make sure that the Garlic
       Marinara is very thick. If it is too runny, the liquid from the
       mussels will make this dish too watery. The butter, too, is very
       strongly seasoned so that only the minumum need be added to give
       the right flavor. We serve this light natural tasting steamed
       dish with rice.

  garnished with whipped cream.  Serves six.
  
  NOTE:  I have just completed assembling the above recipe. Tastes
  good. If it sets up a bit more it will make a nice pudding. If it was
  heated, it would be nice over a couple of scoops of vanilla ice
  cream. No way it's gonna serve six, though.

  One of New Orleans' oldest food establishments, Cafe Sbisa was
  founded by the Sbisa family in 1899, in what was then the thriving
  port and financial district of the old French city. In 1977, the
  business was purchased by two local restauranteurs who completely
  restored the historic building and reopened the cafe two years later.
  The menu still reflects many of the great traditions of "la cuisine
  Creole", but has been expanded to include the finest products from
  across the United States.

  1 1/2 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Grated lemon peel
    1/2 ts Chili powder
      1 c  Rice

      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/4 ts Black pepper
    1/4 ts Paprika
    1/8 ts Garlic powder
 
  Trim the lamb of any excess fat.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix
  together the spice mix ingredients, and rub over the lamb. Let stand
  for 15 minutes. Heat oil in a skillet. Sear the lamb until all sides
  are browned. Remove lamb to a roasting pan. Roast lamb for 35 to 40
  minutes.
  
  While the lamb is cooking, add onions and peppers to the skillet used
  for searing the lamb.  Saute until soft. Add tomatoes, chicken stock,
  basil, lemon and chili powder. Bring to a boil and add the rice.
  Reduce heat and simmer until liquid is absorbed.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  This is a spicy lamb dish that I picked up originally from a local
  newspaper.  Yield:  serves 2-3.
  
  *  Often when boning a leg of lamb you end up with a very ragged
  piece of meat.  Just chop it up into boxy pieces and use more spice
  mix to cover all the surfaces. You will be slicing up the roast
  before serving anyhow.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  1 hour.
  : Precision:  measure the spices.

    1/4 c  Black pepper
    1/4 c  Garlic powder
    1/4 c  Salt
      2 ea Onions, thinly sliced

MMMMM------------------SEASONING MIX (OPTIONAL-----------------------
      1 tb Plus 1 tsp, salt
      1 tb Plus 2 tsp, white pepper
      1 tb Plus 2 tsp, fennel seeds
      1 tb Plus 3/4 tsp, black pepper
  2 1/2 ts Dry mustard
  2 1/2 ts Ground cayenne pepper
 
  Remove fat cap off top of meat (butcher can do this for you) and save.
  Place the roast, standing on the rib bones, in a very large roasting
  pan. Then with a knife make several dozen punctures through the
  silver skin so seasoning can permeate meat.  Pour a very generous,
  even layer of black pepper over the top of the meat (the pepper
  should completely cover it); repeat with the garlic powder, then the
  salt, totally covering the preceding layer.  Carefully arrange the
  onions in an even layer on top so as not to knock off the seasoning.
  Place the fat cap back on top. Refrigerate 24 hours. Bake ribs in a
  550F oven until the fat is dark brown and crispy on top, about 35
  minutes. Remove from oven and cool slightly. Refrigerate until well
  chilled, about 3 hours.  (this is done so the juices will solidify
  and the steaks can be cooked rare.) Remove fat cap and disgard.  With
  the blade of a large knife, scrape off the onions and as much of the
  seasonings as possible and discard. Then with a long knife, slice
  between ribs into 6 steaks (4 will have bones); trim the cooked
  surface of meat from the 2 pieces that were on the outside of the
  roast. Season and cook in your favorite way for steaks. TO BLACKEN
  THE STEAKS: Combine the ingredients of the seasoning mix thoroughly
  in a small bowl; you will have about 8 tablespoons. Sprinkle the
  steaks generously and evenly on both sides with the mix. using about
  4 teaspoons on each steak and pressing it in with your hands. Heat a
  cast iron skillet over very high heat until it is beyond the smoking
  stage and you see white ash on the skillet bottom--at least 10
  minutes.  (The skillet cannot be too hot for this method.)  Place one
  steak in the hot skillet (cook only one side at a time) and cook over
  a very high heat until the underside starts to develop a heavy, black
  crust, about 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the steak over and cook until the
  underside is crusted like the first, about 2 to 3 minutes more.
  Repeat with the remaining steaks.  Serve each steak while piping hot.
  (*NOTE*:  If you don't have a commercial hood vent over your stove,
  this dish may smoke you out of the kitchen. It's worth it! But you
  can also cook it outdoors on a gas grill; a charcoal fire doesn't get
  hot enough to "blacken" the steak properly. If you have a smoke
  detector in your house, you will be able to determine if it is
  working correctly. This is NOT a dish to prepare in an apartment
  building with a central fire alarm system wired into your smoke
  detector.  It causes great excitement! Also, you can be guaranteed
  you will meet your landlord.) From Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen

  TO BLACKEN THE STEAKS: Combine the ingredients of the seasoning mix
  thoroughly in a small bowl; you will have about 8 Tb. Sprinkle the
  steaks generously and evenly on both sides with the mix. using about
  4 ts on each steak and pressing it in with your hands.
  
  Heat a cast iron skillet over very high heat until it is beyond the
  smoking stage and you see white ash on the skillet bottom--at least
  10 minutes. (The skillet cannot be too hot for this method.) Place
  one steak in the hot skillet (cook only one side at a time) and cook
  over a very high heat until the underside starts to develop a heavy,
  black crust, about 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the steak over and cook until
  the underside is crusted like the first, about 2 to 3 minutes more.
  Repeat with the remaining steaks. Serve each steak while piping hot.
  
  (*NOTE*: If you don't have a commercial hood vent over your stove,
  this dish may smoke you out of the kitchen. It's worth it! But you
  can also cook it outdoors on a gas grill; a charcoal fire doesn't get
  hot enough to "blacken" the steak properly. (FHT-if you have a smoke
  detector in your house, you will be able to determine if it is
  working correctly.) This is NOT a dish to prepare in an apartment
  building with a central fire alarm system wired into your smoke
  detector. It causes great excitement! Also, you can be guaranteed you
  will meet your landlord.)

  1 1/2 c  Julienned zucchini (see note
      1 c  Julienned squash (see Note)
      1 x  Very Hot Cajun Sauce/Beef
 
    NOTE:  To julienne squashes, cut peelings 1/8 inch thick and cut
  these
    into strips 1/8 inch wide and 2 inches long; use only strips that
  have
    skin on one surface.  Cut carrots and onions into similar strips.
    In a 13x9-inch ungreased baking pan, combine the beef and pork. Mix
    in the eggs and bread crumbs by hand until thoroughly mixed. Set
    aside.    In a 1-quart saucepan, combine 3 tablespoons of the
  butter,
    the onions, celery, bell peppers, garlic, Worcestershire, Tabasco
  and
    meat seasoning mix.  Saute over high heat about 5 minutes, stirring
    frequently and scraping the pan bottom well.  Remove from heat and
    cool.  Add the sauteed vegetable mixture and 1/4 cup of the milk to
    the meat and mix well by hand.  Form into a 12x8-inch loaf and
  center
    in the pan.  Bake at 450F until brown on top, about
       30    minutes.
    Remove from oven; pour off drippings, reserve 2-1/2 tablespoons. Set
    meat and drippings aside.    Meanwhile, boil the potatoes until fork
    tender; drain, reserving about 1 cup of the water. Place the
    potatoes, while still hot, in a large mixing bowl with the
  remaining 1
    stick butter, 1/2 cup milk, the salt and white pepper. Stir with a
    wooden spoon until broken up, then beat with a metal whisk (or
    electric mixer with a paddle) until creamy and velvety smooth.
  (NOTE:
    Mix in some of the reserved potato water if potatoes are not creamy
    enough.)  In a large skillet (preferably non-stick) combine the
    reserved drippings with the carrots, onions and vegetable seasoning
    mix; saute over high heat 1-1/2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add
  the
    zucchini and yellow squash and continue sauteing until vegetables
  are
    noticeably brighter in color, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring
    occasionally.  Remove from heat.    Mound undrained vegetables on
  top
    of the meat loaf, away from the edges.  Layer the mashed potatoes
    evenly over the top of the vegetables and top edges of the meat,
  using
    all the potatoes.  Bake at 525F until brown on top, about 8 to 10
    minutes.  Serve immediately with about 1/2 cup Very Hot Cajun Sauce

      Title: CAJUN SOFT-SHELL CRABS ON BUNS
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 md Soft-shell crabs, cleaned
      1 c  Skim milk
    3/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Paprika
    1/4 ts Garlic powder
    1/8 ts Cayenne pepper, or to taste
      4 tb Low-fat butter
      4    Round sandwich buns or
           -rolls, toasted
      4 tb Cajun Mayonnaise
      2    Scallions, thinly sliced
 
  Soft-shell crabs are one of the great culinary joys of springtime.
  They should be purchased fresh, and most fish markets are happy to
  clean them for you. If not, the technique takes a little courage, but
  once you get the knack, it's really quite easy: Rinse each crab under
  cold water and, with scissors, snip off the head about 1/4" behind
  the eyes. Turn the crab over on its back; lift and pull off the
  triangular apron on the lower part of the shell. Flip the crab over
  and pull back the points of the top shell. Remove and discard the
  gills on both sides. Rinse the cleaned crab and pat dry.
  
  1. Soak prepared crabs in milk for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a bag,
  combine flour, paprika, garlic powder and cayenne. Shake well;
  reserve.
  
  2. Remove the crabs from the milk and dredge in the seasoned flour.
  Shake off any excess flour.
  
  3. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute crabs,
  two at a time, for 4-5 minutes per side, or until crispy and browned.
  Remove to a paper towel to drain.
  
  4. Spread each toasted bun with 1 tablespoon of Cajun Mayonnaise, or
  more if desired. Sprinkle scallions on bottom half of bun, then top
  with a crab. Cover with top half of the bun and serve immediately.

 Categories: Spices
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  2 Tablespoons Red Pepper 1 Tablespoon Black Pepper 1 Tablespoon White
  Pepper 1 Tablespoon Thyme 1 1/2 Teaspoon Garlic Powder 1 1/2 Teaspoon
  Onion Powder 1
      1/2    Teaspoon Seasoned salt
  
  Mix peppers, herbs and spices, store in an air tight container.
  
  Spice is great on most all meats; including pork chops and steaks;
  chicken and seafoods.  The food to be blackened should be moistened
  on both sides with butter or margarine. Then coated with the spice
  mix. The coated meat should then be cooked in a white hot cast iron
  skillet on both sides until degree of wellness is reached and spice
  looks like a black crust. Shrimp should be peeled, leaving only the
  tails on. Foods my also be cooked on very hot grill. Always cook in
  well ventilated area, as mixture may smoke alot.  Amount of coating
  is to taste.  This is a very spicy mix. Start lite and work your way
  up.
  
  Blackened shrimp makes for great appetizer along with a good cocktail
  sauce.  Shrimp need to be attened continually while cooking as it only
  requires a couple minutes each side.

  This spice mix is loosly based on a spice mix from the Prudhomme

  can be used to season any seafood dish. I also use it to season
  Porcupine Meatballs and other "cajun" inspired dishes.

  Combine all ingredients.  Rub mixture into meat.  If grilling, let
  meat stand 30 minutes.  This works well when smoking brisket. Rub
  mixture on meaty side of 2 briskets. Do not trim fat from fat side.
  Place meaty sides together, roll, and retie.  Place in smoker for 8
  to 10 hours depending on size of brisketss.  Use meat thermometer to
  determine doneness. For ribs, rub mixture all over ribs and cook as
  you alwaaaays do. This amount will be enough for 6 to 8 pork chops.
  On you can use it on hamburger patties

 Categories: Desserts, Cajun
      Yield: 15 Servings
 
      7 tb Butter, unsalted; melted
    1/4 c  Butter, unsalted; melted
     16 c  French bread cubes, dry
           -packed
      3    Eggs
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Vanilla extract
      1 ts Nutmeg, grated
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground
      3 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Sultanas
    3/4 c  Coconut, flaked
    1/2 c  Pecans, toasted; coarsely
           -chopped

MMMMM-------------------------RUM SAUCE------------------------------
      1 c  Butter, unsalted
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      2    Egg; beaten until frothy
    1/2 c  Dark rum

MMMMM-------------------------SOFT CREAM------------------------------
      1 pt Whipping cream
    1/3 c  Sugar, confectioners,
           -sifted
      1 tb Pure vanilla extract
      2 tb Cognac
      2 ts Frangelico Liqueur
    1/4 c  Dairy sour cream
 
  Pour 7 tablespoons butter into a 13" x 9" baking pan; swirl it around
  to coat bottom and sides.  Pour excess butter and additional 1/4 cup
  butter into a small bowl; set aside. Place bread cubes in buttered
  baking dish; set aside.  In a large bowl, beat eggs and sugar with an
  electric mixer until thickened and light lemon-coloured, 3 to 4
  minutes. Add vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, milk, raisins, coconut,
  pecans and reserved butter; beat on low speed to combine.  Pour
  liquid over bread in baking dish; stir to distribute nuts, coconut
  and raisins evenly. Set pan aside until bread has absorbed all of
  liquid, 30 to 45 minutes. Press bread down into liquid often to cover
  all cubes with liquid. Preheat oven to 350F. Bake in preheated oven
  until crusty and golden brown on top, 45 to 60 minutes. While pudding
  is baking, prepare Rum Sauce and Soft Cream. Cool bread pudding to
  lukewarm.  When bread pudding has cooled, slice into squares. Place a
  spoonful of rum sauce in botttom of each serving bowl; add a square
  of bread pudding.  Top with a generous dollop of cream. Makes 15 to
  18 servings.
  
  TO PREPARE RUM SAUCE, using an electric mixer, cream butter and sugar
  mixture until light and fluffy.  Put mixture in top of a double
  boiler over simmering water; cook 20 minutes, whisking often. The
  mixture should be silky smooth and light in colour.  Whisk 2
  tablespoons hot butter mixture into beaten eggs, then 2 tablespoons
  more. Whisk warmed egg mixture slowly into remaining butter mixture.
  Cook mixture over barely simmering water until thickened, 4 to 5
  minutes, whisking constantly. Cool slightly; whisk in rum. Sauce may
  be kept warm over hot water until served.
  
  TO PREPARE SOFT CREAM, chill beaters and a medium bowl until very
  cold. Place all ingredients in bowl; beat with an electric mixer on
  medium- high speed until soft, loose peaks from, 3 to 4 minutes. The
  cream should have a slightly runny, cloud-like consistency that
  softly drapes over the bread pudding.  Do not overbeat. Cover tightly
  and refrigerate until served.
  
  "I know of no dessert that gives me greater pleasure than the bread
  pudding desserts I discovered during my trips to Louisiana. This
  version is light and airy rather than heavy and dense. It has an
  exciting combination of tastes and textures to please your mouth. It
  is sinfully rich and guaranteed to please the most ardent dessert
  fan. I'm sure you will enjoy this as much as I did."

    2/3 c  ;cold water
      2 tb Honey
      1 ts Lemon juice; preferably
           -fresh
 
  For the dough, combine the matzo meal, cake meal, 1/2 cup sugar,
  ground almonds, cinnamon, and cloves in a medium-sized bowl. Add the
  oil, egg, and 3/4 cup water, and mix very well for form a stiff
  dough. Knead the dough with your hands a few times to complete the
  mixing. Evenly press the dough into a greased 8-inch-square baking
  pan. Use a knife to cut the dough into diamonds.  First, cut the
  dough crosswise into about 4 even rows. Then make diagonal, parallel
  cuts through the rows. (If desired, cut the dough into squares,
  instead.)  Press a whole almond into the center of each piece. Bake
  the cake in a preheated 375-degree oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or
  until it is browned and firm.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare the syrup.  Put the sugar and water into a small
  saucepan.  Stir over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves and
  the syrup comes to a boil; then boil the syrup, uncovered and
  undisturbed, for 8 minutes.  Stir in the honey and lemon juice.
  Remove the syrup from the heat, and set it aside to cool slightly.
  
  When the cake has finished baking, remove it from the oven, and recut
  the pieces.  Pour the syrup evenly over the hot cake. Let the cake
  rest for several hours to completely absorb the syrup. After the
  syrup has been absorbed, cover the cake with aluminum foil or plastic
  wrap and store it at room temperature. Makes about 16 pieces. Source:

  Note:  This is a passover version of a cake popular with Turkish and
  Greek Jews throughout the year.  The cake is soaked in a sugar-honey
  syrup after it is baked. For best flavor and texture, tishpishti
  should be made at least one day ahead.  It will stay well for several
  days.

  *If using self rising flour; omit babng powder and salt.
  
  Buttermilk Doughnuts: Do not use self rising flour. Substitute
  buttermilk for the milk. Decrease baking powder to 2 ts and beat in 1
  ts baking soda.
  
  NOTE: Hot fat cools somewhat when foods are dropped into it. While
  foods are frying, temperature of fat should be 370F to 380F. If fat
  is too hot, foods brown before they are cooked through; if too cool,
  foods become grease-soaked. A deep-fat thermometer is a good
  investment; checking it helps maintain a constant temperature. Do not
  use a candy thermometer for deep-fat fiying as it does not register
  high enough.

      Yield: 6 Servings

      2 tb Olive oil - extra-virgin
      2 lb Asparagus - trimmed and cut
           -into 1-inch pieces
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
      4 c  Vegetable Broth - (see
           -recipe) OR canned low-
           Sodium chicken broth
      4    Eggs
    1/2 c  Parmesan - fresly grated OR
           -Pecorino, PLUS extra
           For serving
      6 sl Italian bread - toasted
 
  Number of Servings:   6
  
  1.  In a large saucepan, cook the garlic in the olive oil over
  moderate heat, stirring constantly, until golden, about 3 minutes.
  Add the asparagus and cook until bright green, about 5 minutes. Add
  the salt, pepper and Vegetable Broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the
  heat to moderately low and simmer until the asparagus are tender,
  about 15 minutes.
  
  2.  In a small bowl, beat the eggs with 1/2 cup of the cheese. Reduce
  the heat to low so that the soup is no longer simmering, and very
  slowly ladle about 2 cups of the hot soup into the beaten eggs,
  whisking constantly. Once incorporated, gradually stir the egg
  mixture into the soup in the saucepan.  Increase the heat to
  moderately low and cook the soup, whisking constantly, until it just
  thickens, about 8 minutes. Do not allow the soup to boil or the eggs
  will curdle. Remove from the heat.
  
  3.  Place one slide of toasted bread into each soup bowl. Ladle the
  hot soup on top and serve with additional grated cheese.
  
  Serves 6.
  
  NOTE:  Thickening soup with bread is typical of rustic Italian
  cooking, in which nothing goes to waste.  The toasts may be made from
  day-old or slightly stale bread. Serve with a Sauvignon Blanc.

  tentacles finely.  Set them aside. Saut 82 the onion and the garlic
  in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the butter until the onion is
  soft. Add the tentacles and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the spinach and
  saut E9, stirring, until it has wilted. Drain off any extra liquid
  and cool the spinach. In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, egg,
  parsley, and the cooled spinach mixture. Mix thoroughly and season
  with salt, pepper, and hot pepper flakes. Stuff the mixture loosely
  into the squid and close the openings securely with a toothpick. Use
  the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to grease a rectangular baking
  dish large enough to hold the squid comfortably in one layer. Arrange
  the squid in the dish and add the wine and tomatoes. Season with
  salt, pepper and more hot pepper flakes, if you wish. Bake for 40 to
  45 minutes, or until the squid is tender and the sauce has thickened.
  If there is too much sauce, raise the oven temperature and allow the
  liquid to reduce.  If there is too little, add more white wine. Serve
  the squid with lemon quarters. Do not overstuff the squid or they may
  split while they cook.  Rice and braised fennel go well with this
  dish.

      Title: CALAMARIA GEMISTA (STUFFED SQUID)
 Categories: Seafood, Greek
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Large fresh squid
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 c  Coarsely chopped onion
           -(packed)
    1/3 c  Long-grain rice
    1/4 c  Pine nuts
      2 lg Garlic cloves; chopped
    1/4 c  Currants
    3/4 c  Dry white or red wine
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
           -to taste
    3/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
           -(packed)
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh dill, packed
      4 tb Chopped fresh mint
      2 c  Peeled, seeded tomatoes
           -(chopped)
 
  Wash and clean squid.  Grasp the head just below the eyes, pull it
  off from the rest of the body, and set it aside. Cut away the thin
  purplish membrane on the outside of the tail section. Using your
  index finger, scoop out and discard the guts and thin cartilage
  "icicle" on the inside of the tail section.  Rinse tail sections
  inside and out and set aside in a colander to drain.  Take the head
  section in one hand and put pressure with your thumb and forefinger
  around the mouth and eyes, to squeeze them out. Discard mouth and
  eyes.
  
  Chop the squid tentacles and have them ready, as they will be used in
  the stuffing.
  
  In a large skillet, heat half the oilve oil and saute onion until
  wilted. Add rice, tentacles, and pine nuts and saute over medium-low
  heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and currants to rice and stir
  quickly with a woodent spoon.  Pour in 1/4 cup wine and 1/4 cup
  water. Season with salt and pepper.  Reduce heat to low and simmer,
  covered, until liquid is almost completely absorbed and rice is soft
  but only about half cooked, about 15 minutes.  About 5 minutes before
  removing skillet from heat, add parsley, dill and mint. Remove and
  let cool enough to handle.
  
  Using a small teaspoon or a butter knife, carefully fill about three
  quarters of each squid with the rice mixture. Use toothpicks to secure
  closed.  Pour remaining olive oil into a large stewing pot. Place
  squid carefully in pot.  Pour in remaining wine and enough water to
  cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, covered for
  about 1-1/2 hours, or until rice is cooked and squid fork-tender.
  Twenty minutes before removing squid from heat, add chopped tomatoes
  to pot and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Check throughout
  cooking to see if more water is necessary so that mixture doesn't dry
  out.  Serve squid hot or cold with a simple green salad.
  
  SERVING SUGGESTIONS: This dish needs a delicate wine such as a Robola
  Callinga or Santorini Boutari.  Serve with wild greens (horta),
  'horiatiki salata (village salad), and a beautiful olive bread.

      3    Onion; peeled and chopped
      1 ts Cumin seeds, whole
      2    Jalapeno pepper; seeded and
           -chopped
      2 c  Chili sauce, prepared
      4    Tomato; chopped
      2    Green bell pepper; seeded
           -and chopped
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
      1 c  Red wine
           Salt
 
  Brown the chicken. Heat a large frying pan and add the oil. Saute the
  garlic, onions, cumin seeds and jalapeno peppers until the onions are
  clear. Add all to a heavy pot and bring to a simmer. Cook for 1 hour.
  This one has to be different. If it came from California it is
  expected to be unusual. Try this. No avocado, but chicken and a very
  mild chili sauce from a jar. It is really a great dish, although one
  should not confuse it with the old-line chili cookers' product. By

      Title: CALIFORNIA DIP BREAD (ABM)*
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Loaf
 
      1 pk Yeast
  3 1/3 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      1    Egg
    3/4 c  Cottage cheese
    3/4 c  Sour cream
      3 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Water
      1    Envelope Lipton's Onion
 
  Slightly warm the next 6 ingredients and pour into pan. Select white
  bread and push 'start'.
  
  NOTE:  I have made this recipe manually, and it's fabulous. I used an
  entire envelope of Lipton's Recipe Secrets (Onion), and did the
  following:
  
  Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 warm water in the bottom of large mixing
  bowl. Add the butter, egg, sour cream, and cottage cheese (all
  slightly warmed) and mix well. Stir in the soup mix and the sugar,
  and lastly the baking soda, mixing all well.  Add the flour about 1
  cup at a time, mixing thoroughly - after last addition, start using
  you hands to mix and knead. Knead well (about 10-15 minutes) until
  dough is elastic (my dough was too sticky and I ended up adding a
  little additional flour). Let rise until double (about 1 1/2 hours)
  in a lightly greased bowl (<-- important! I didn't grease the bowl
  and it got sticky on the bottom); punch down and knead lightly. Place
  dough in greased baking container of choice, and let rise again until
  double again (about another 45 minutes). Bake at 350 degrees for
  40-45 minutes, or until cake tester comes out clean. Remove from pan
  immediately and cool completely on cooling rack. This recipe made
  enough for 1 loaf in my breadcrock (about 3/4 of the dough), and the
  remaining 1/4 made 2 mini-loaves. The mini-loaves, however, only bake
  about 15 minutes or so.  Would probably produce two regular-sized
  loaf pans of bread. Would be excellent with deli meats or used
  grilled for other sandwiches! The mini-loaves or a decorative tube
  pan would turn it into wonderful cocktail bread.  Tastes like a very
  moist, slightly sweet double-onion bagel.  I am anxious to use this
  same recipe and experiment with other soup mixes!!

  Spray loaf pan with Pam or ?. Open pineapple and drain off juice mix
  dry ingredients together in large bowl. In blender, process together
  applesauce, egg, bananas and pineapple add to dry mixture, add

  baked in preheated 350F oven for 60 minutes or until golden and tests
  done. Remove from pan and rest on a board or rack on its side till
  completely cooled. Refrigerate wrapped.  Freezes well.
  
  Now for the variables, I have made this with no apricots but with one
  fresh apple, chopped ( not peeled). I have made this with and without
  raisins. Less sweet but good both ways. I am eager to try it with
  fresh bluberries in place of the apricots. I have also made it
  without the pineapple because I forgot to buy some, instead I used 1
  cup apple juice. If you don't have the soy flour or the dry milk,
  just add the equivilent of flour or oat bran or??

      2 c  Monterey Jack cheese;
           -shredded and divided
 
  Cook noodles according to package directions and set aside. In a large
  skillet, saute mushrooms, green and red peppers, and green onions in 2
  tablespoons of butter. Cook for 5 minutes, add garlic and stir. Remove
  vegetables from pan and set aside.  In the same pan, melt the
  remaining butter over medium heat, blend in flour, then gradually
  pour in milk. Stir until smooth and thickened. Blend in seasoning
  salt, wine, white pepper, and 1 cup of the shredded cheese. Cook and
  stir until cheese melts. To the sauce, add the noodles and

  until bubbly.
  
  Note:  This sauce can be made ahead of time, covered, and
  refrigerated. Let stand for 20 minutes or so at room temperature
  before baking. You might need a little more butter, I had to use more
  than stated in the ingredients; you may get by with the amount listed.

           Canned whole green chiles,
           -chopped
    3/4 ts Ground cumin
    1/4 ts Ground Mexican oregano
    1/2 ts Salt
      4    Corn tortillas
      4    To 8 eggs
      2    Avocados, peeled and thinly
           -sliced lengthwise
    1/2 c  Grated Monterey Jack or
           -Cheddar cheese
      4    Lettuce leaves, coarsely
           -chopped
 
  ...Serve fresh fruit, warm wheat-flour tortillas, sweet butter, honey
  and coffee for a great brunch.
  
  1.  In a medium-size saucepan, heat the oil, add the chopped onion,
  and fry over medium heat until the onion is translucent. Add tomato
  juice, garlic, chiles, herbs, and salt.  Reduce heat to simmer for
  about 10 minutes. Sauce can be made a day or hours ahead of time and
  left at this point.
  
  2.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Warm the tortillas by wrapping in
  foil and placing on the 4 serving plates (Mexican pottery if
  possible) in the warm oven. At the same time, warm the extra
  tortillas you are serving as bread.
  
  3.  Poach the eggs, using an egg poacher or a frying pan of hot water
  with 2 tablespoons vinegar and 1 teaspoon salt added. First break an
  egg into a cup, then stir the water in the frying pan vigorously in a
  circular motion. As you stir, slide the egg from the cup into the
  water. Cover the pan when all eggs have been added.
  
  4.  To assemble the dish, place a tortilla on a plate. Top with a
  circle of avocado slices, then arrange a drained poached egg (or 2
  eggs) on top, spoon sauce over, and sprinkle with cheese. Place in
  the oven until cheese melts.  Add the lettuce garnish after the
  cheese has melted.
  
  Variation: Instead of the tortillas, rinse large "cupped" iceberg
  lettuce leaves and serve the eggs topped with sauce in the lettuce
  leaves.

      Title: CALLOS A LA MADRILENA
 Categories: Spanish, Snacks
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb "honeycomb" tripe
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
      1 sm Tomato, chopped
      1    Pig's foot or veal knuckle,
           -split in half
      2    Sprigs parsley
     10    Peppercorns, lightly crushed
      2    Cloves, crushed
      1 ds Of nutmeg
      2    Bay leaves
    1/2 ts Dried thyme, or equivalent
           -amount of fresh
           Salt
      1 sm Onion, coarsely chopped
      6    Cloves garlic, peeled
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped
    1/4 lb Chorizo (or Italian
           -sausage), in 1/4-inch
           -slices
    1/4 c  Diced cured (unsmoked) ham
      1 tb Flour
      1 tb Sweet red (Spanish) paprika
    1/2    Dried red chili pepper,
           -crumbled (remove seeds if
           -you wish)
 
  (Tripe, Madrid Style)
  
  Tripe is especially favored in Spain and, in fact, most countries
  where there is still a strong Spanish influence. This isn't
  surprising, because it makes a number of very different, but
  extremely tasty dishes. It requires long cooking times (less here
  because it is almost always cleaned and partially precooked when you
  buy it), but it keeps very well for days, in the refrigerator, and is
  even better when reheated than when first prepared.  Since it's
  difficult to buy half a pig's foot or half a veal knuckle, this
  recipe makes enough for 4 - 6 servings as a main course. Make a full
  recipe a day or two ahead of time, serve as many tapas as needed,
  then enjoy the rest as a main course or snacks. This can be reheated
  very nicely in the microwave, by the way.
  
  To serve 4 - 6 as a main course, or make 12 - 18 tapas:
  
  Rinse the tripe well, then put it into a rather large kettle and add
  cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil, then drain immediately. Cut
  the tripe into 1 1/2-inch squares and return it to the empty kettle.
  Add 3 cups cold water and the wine, tomato, pig's foot or veal
  knuckle, parsley, peppercorns, cloves, nutmeg, bay leaves, thyme,
  salt to taste, coarsely chopped onion and the garlic. Cover and
  simmer over low heat for 4 to 5 hours, until the tripe is almost
  tender.
  
  Heat the oil in a skillet and saute the finely chopped onion until it
  is wilted.  Add the chorizo and ham and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in
  the flour and paprika and cook 1 minute more. Add 1/2 cup of the
  liquid from the tripe kettle, a little at a time, and cook-stir until
  the mixture thickens.
  
  Add this and the chile to the tripe.  Cover and cook 1 ~ 2 hours more.
  Remove the cover and continue cooking until the tripe is very tender.
  
  Remove the pig's foot or veal knuckle from the tripe. Remove and
  discard all skin, bone and fat.  Cut the meat into pieces and stir
  into the tripe.
  
  Serve in warmed bowls or shallow individual tapa-size dishes. Serve
  with good crusty bread for sopping up the sauce.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------DOUGH MIXTURE----------------------------
      1 c  Warm water
      2 ts Yeast
      2 tb Oil
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Sucanat
  1 1/4 c  Whole wheat flour or 1 c.

  1 1/4 c  Unbleached flour

MMMMM----------------------FILLING MIXTURE---------------------------
    1/2 tb Oil
    1/2 c  Chopped onion (1 sm. onion)
      2 c  Chopped mushrooms (about
           -1/2 pound)
    1/2 c  Chopped celery
    1/2 c  Chopped tomatoes
    1/2 c  Sliced black olives
      1 ts Basil
      1 ts Oregano
      2 tb Tomato paste
      2 c  Crumbled firm tofu (1 12-oz.
           -package, drained)
      2 tb Nutritional yeast
      1 tb Arrowroot
      3 tb Salsa (optional)
           Salt and pepper to taste

MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
 
  Dissolve yeast in warm water (about 105 degrees or just warm to
  touch). Let sit for about 5 minutes or untilyeast starts coming to
  the top of the water. Add the oil, salt and Sucanat and mix well. Add
  the whole whet flour and mix with wooden spoon, scraping the sides of
  the bowl often. Stir for about 150 strokes (the gluten strands will
  be forming). Add the rest of the flour except fo the last 1/4 cup.
  Stir vigorously. If the dough seems stiff enough to handle, don't add
  the rest of the flour; if not, stir in the rest of the flour. Turn
  dough out onto a floured board and knead for about 5 minutes. Try not
  to add extra flour as the more flour you add the drier the final
  product will be. Oil or wet your hands so dough doesn't stick to your
  hands while kneading. Place dough into a clean bowl, cover with a
  piece of plastic wrap (so dough won't stick to it, should it rise and
  it it) and set in a warm place to rise for about an hour.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare the filling; heat a heavy skillet over a medium
  heat. Add the onions, stir and reduce heat.Cover with a lid directly
  over the onions, to let the onions "sweat." When onions are
  transparent, add mushrooms, celery, tomatoes, olives, basil, oregano,
  and tomato paste. Mix well and continue to cook for aout 5 minutes.
  Add the crumbled tofu, nutritional yeast, arrowroot, salsa (if
  desired) and salt to taste. Stir and simmer for about 15 minutes. If
  the dough mixture isn't quite ready yet, let mixture cool for a bit.
  
  When dough is doubled in bulk (or nearly doubled--don't let it rise
  too long), punch it down and turn it out onto a floured counter
  again. Divide it into 6 equal, or nearly-equal portions. Roll each
  portion into a circle (or pat it into a circle) about 1/4 inch thick.
  For each portion, use 1/6 of the filling, palcing the filling over
  1/2 of the circle. Try to leave a 1/2-inch rim around the outside.
  Fould dough over, stretching, if necessary. Press down around the
  outside with a fork, dipped in water so it doesn't stick.
  
  Place on an oiled baking sheet and lightly brush with oil over the
  tops. Make a few incisions with a knife on each calzone.Bake in a
  preheated 450-degree oven for 15 to 18 minutes or until golden brown.
  It is okay to bake in two batches if you have a small oven.
  
  Serves 6 or 3 calzone-crazed people.

      Title: CAMPFIRE MEATBALLS
 Categories: Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Ground beef
    1/4 c  Dry bread crumbs
      1    Egg; slightly beaten
    3/4 ts Garlic salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
           Heavy aluminum foil
      2 md Zucchini; halved,
           -- then sliced crosswise
           -- into 1/2 inch slices.
      2 c  Prepared spaghetti sauce
           Grated Parmesan cheese
           Garlic bread sticks
           -- (optional)
 
  1. In medium bowl, combine ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, 1/4 cup
  water, garlic salt and pepper, mixing lightly but thoroughly. Shape
  into 24 (approx 1-1/4 inch) meatballs.
  
  2. Cut four 18x12 inch long sheets heavy duty aluminum foil. Place
  equal amounts of meatballs and zucchini in center of each; top each
  with 1/3 cup spaghetti sauce. Bring shorter edges of foil together
  over the center; fold down loosely to seal, allowing room for heat
  expansion and circulation. Fold in open ends to seal.
  
  3. Place packets on grid over medium ash-covered coals, Grill,
  uncovered, 16 to 18 minutes or until meatball centers are no longer
  pink and zucchini is tender, truning packets over once.
  
  4. To serve, carefully unfold ends and tops of packets; sprinkle
  cheese over meatballs. Serve with garlic bread sticks, dipping into
  sauce, if desired.
  
  Cooks tip: To check the temperature of the coals, cautiously hold
  your hand palm side down, at cooking height (just above the grid).
  Count the number of seconds you can hold your hand in that position
  before the heat is uncomfortable and you have to pull it away; 4
  seconds for medium coals.

  tempted to add liquid.If it will not hold to-gether its because the
  shortening and butter were not sufficiently well creamed. Divide into
  two portions and roll half to 1/4 in. thickness and spread out on
  bottom of a greased pan. Cover with following date mixture: 1/2 cup
  of dates chopped, 1/2 cup brown sugar, one tblsp. cornstarch, 1 cup

 Categories: Fruits/nuts, Desserts, Candies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Plump, pink grapefruit,
           - preferably organic
  2 1/2 c  Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Water
      2 tb Corn syrup
           Superfine sugar; for coating
      5 oz Semisweet chocolate
      1 tb Butter
 
  SCORE GRAPEFRUIT INTO QUARTERS and carefully pull off peels or juice
  fruits and cut halves again in half. Place peels in large pan, cover
  them with cold water and bring to boil. Simmer 25 minutes. Remove
  peels and let them cool until they are easy to handle. Hold peels
  firmly against counter and gently scrape away most of white pith just
  below skin. Cut cleaned peels into strips with knife or scissors as
  narrow or wide as you like. In 2-quart saucepan, mix together sugar,
  water and corn syrup. Bring to boil. When syrup is clear, add peels,
  lower heat and cook slowly until peels are translucent, about 1 hour.
  Set cake rack over baking sheet. Remove peels a few at a time and
  spread them out on rack to drain about 15 minutes. While they are
  draining, thickly cover large plate with super- fine sugar. Set
  several pieces at a time in sugar and turn them to coat them. When
  evenly coated, set them aside on another plate or piece of parchment
  paper thinly coated with sugar. This process will need to be done in
  several batches. If sugar become lumpy with beads of syrup, pass it
  through a strainer, then continue using it. Set aside sugared peels
  about 1 hour or until they are dried. Carefully package them in tin
  or plastic container and store either in cupboard or refrigerator. To
  dip peels in chocolate, melt semisweet chocolate over simmering water
  along with butter. Stir well to ensure that mixture is smooth before
  removing from heat. Dip each rind into chocolate, coating most of it
  but leaving a little "handle" to grasp. Or, completely immerse each
  rind in chocolate, then remove with 2 forks or pair of chopsticks.
  Set slices on parchment paper or cake rack and place in cool place to
  harden. Once chocolate has set, pieces can be stored in refrigerator.
  Chocolate will discolor when it cools but will become dark and glossy
  again once brought to room temperature. Makes 3 Cups

      Title: CANDIED MINT LEAVES
 Categories: Candies, Desserts, Snacks
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
     40    Apple or Pineapple Mint
           -Leaves (select tender
           -leaves with no blemishes)
      2    Egg whites (may need more)
           Water
           Powdered sugar
 
  The large downy leaves of the apple and pineapple mint leaves take up
  this coating very well which will not readily adhere to most of the
  varieties of the mint. This is a nice confection that has many uses.
  ******************************************************* **************
  Froth up the egg whites with a little water. With a small brush,
  paint the leaves with the egg white and dust both sides with the
  powdered sugar. Set each leaf on a sheet of wax paper and allow to
  dry. They will dry with a frosty crystalized coating and make a nice
  garnish for desserts or a pleasant candy treat.

      Title: CANDIED ORANGE PEEL
 Categories: Fruits, Holiday
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
           INGREDIENTS:
      8    Oranges
           Water
      1 c  Boiling water
      4 c  Sugar
 
  Makes about 3-4 lbs of candy.
  
  (TIP):   Collect  the  orange  halves over a period of time and
  refrigerate them in a plastic bag until you have enough to prepare
  candied peel. You may candy *whole* orange halves, if you wish.
   Just boile them without cutting them into strips. When cooled, they
  make lovely containers for candies and nuts, or holiday desserts.
  
  Wash the oranges.  Cut into halves and squeeze out the juice. Use the
  juice for some other purpose,  of course. Place the oranges into a
  large saucepan and cover with cold water.
  
  Place over high heat and heat to a boil.   Add cold water to cover
  again. Heat to a boil and drain.
   Repeat this process five times in all. Drain well and scoop out the
  pulp. Cut the oranges into 1/4 inch wide strips.
  
  Combine  1 cup of boiling water with 2 cups of the sugar. Heat until
  the sugar is dissolved.   Stir in the orange strips. Place over
  medium heat and boil for about 30  minutes,  until  all  the liquid
  is evaporated. Watch carefully so the peels don't scorch.
   Cool.   Roll the strips  in  the remaining 2 cups of sugar. Place on
  waxed paper  to  dry. Package and store in airtight containers.

      1 c  Water
      4 c  Unbleached flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 c  Milk
 
  Thinly peel the oranges, using a vegetable peeler. Cut the orange

  them and enjoy.) Combine the orange rind and 1 cup of water in a 2
  quart saucepan and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover, and
  simmer for 15 minutes or until the rind is tender. Add the 1 cup of
  sugar and continue cooking, uncovered, until the mixture is syrupy,
  about 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, sift the
  flour, baking powder and salt together in a bowl and set aside.
  Cream the butter and 1/2 cup of sugar together until light and
  fluffy, using a electric mixer set on medium. Add the eggs and blend
  well. Blend in the cooled orange rind mixture. Add the dry ingredients
  alternately with the milk to the creamed mixture, beating well after
  each addition. Pour the batter into 2 greased 9 X 5 X 3-inch loaf
  pans. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. oven for 50 minutes or until
  a cake tester or wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean.
  Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to wire racks to
  finish cooling. Wrap in aluminum foil and let stand overnight before
  slicing. This bread slices better when it has cooled for 24 hours.

 Categories: Cookies, Desserts
      Yield: 30 Medium
 
      2 c  Butter
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      4 x  Egg yolks
      2 ts Vanilla
  4 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      3 tb Peppermint candy
           Red food colouring
 
  Cream together butter and sugar.  Add egg yolks and vanilla and mix
  well. Sift flour and salt together and beat into butter mixture until
  well mixed. When ready, divide dough in half.  To one half, add 1/2
  ts. red food colouring.  Using about a tablespoon of dough, roll a 4"
  strip of each colour (no fatter than a pencil). Place the two
  coloured rolls side-by-side and press lightly together.  Gently twist
  like a rope and place on an ungreased cookie sheet 1" apart. Curve
  the top like a candy cane and bake in a pre-heated oven at 350 F. for
  about 15 minutes; do not brown. Sprinkle with crushed peppermint
  candy before cool. Makes 20-30 medium cookies. Personal Note:  After
  trial and error, I found that it is easier to take each tablespoon of
  cookie dough and roll in hands to form rough cylinder. Then put on
  flat surface vertically. Using fingers and palm in same direction,
  gently roll left and right until the size of a pencil. (the dough,
  that is):)  Pick a time to do these cookies when you're feeling
  creative and have patience. It's fun and they are yummy! The end
  product is worth the trouble.

           No ingredients; see text
 
                          Stages of Syrup Cooking Slightly more cooking
  is required on damp or rainy days than on a dry , clear day.
  Allowance is made for this in the following table. The higher
  temperature should be used on a damp day while the lower is right for
  clear weather. Soft ball, for fondant, fudge, panocha_______________
  234F. to 238F. Firm ball, for caramels______________________________
  246F. to 248F. Hard ball, for taffy_________________________________
  265F. to 270F. Crack stage, for butterscotch________________________
  290F. to 300F. Hard crack, for brittles, sticks, lollypops__________
  300F. to 310F. Hard crack stage, for clear hard candies_____________
  to 310F.
                            Cold Water Test
      Pour about 1/2 teaspoon os the hot candy into a cup nearly full
  of very cold water. Shape the syrup with the fingers of one hand.
  Soft ball: The syrup can be formed into a soft ball which flatens on
  removal from the water. Firm ball: The syrup can be formed into a
  ball which offers some resistance to the fingers. Hard ball: The ball
  which is formed is distinctly chewy. Crack: The mixture sounds britle
  when struck against the side of the cup; it can be broken by crushing
  between the fingers. Hard crack: The brittle mixture will not stick
  to the teeth.
      If a thermometer is used, it should be tested in boiling water. It
  should register 212 F. If 214 F., cook candy 2 degrees higher, if 210
  F., cook candy 2 degrees lower. Make your adjustments accordingly.

      Title: CANDY MELT ROSES
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     14 oz Candy Melts - (1 package)
    1/2 c  Light corn syrup
 
  Melt candy melts according to package directions.  Add heated light
  corn syrup and stir until thoroughly mixed. Let set at room
  temperature in an airtight plastic bag for at least 24 hours or up to
  one week. Candy becomes easier to work with as it sets.  When ready
  to use, knead a small amount until it reaches a workable consistency.
  
  MODELING A ROSE: Start with the base and mold a cone that's
  approximately 1-1/2 inch high from a 3/4-inch diameter ball of
  modeling candy. Next, make petals. Flatten 3/8-inch ball of modeling
  candy into a circle that's about 1/4-inch thick on one side and about
  the diameter of a dime. Make several petals this size. Wrap first
  petal around the point of the cone to form a bud.  Now press three
  more petals around the base of the bud. Gently pinch edges of petals.
  Make five more petals using slightly larger balls of modeling candy.
  Flatten, then thin edge with finger and cup petals. Press petals
  under first row of petals. Continue adding petals, placing them in
  between and slightly lower than previous row. For a fuller flower,
  continue adding petals in this manner.
  
  TO MAKE CANDY LEAVES: On the back of clean, thoroughly dried, grape
  or rose leaves, paint on melted Candy Melts with a soft pastry or
  decorator's brush. Pull out pointed or curved edges to resemble
  certain kinds of leaves. Let coating set and when completely dry,
  carefully peel off candy.

 Categories: Vietnam, Seafood
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
     10    Crab legs or several hard
           -shell crabs
           Shrimp paste, prepared as
           -for Shrimp on Sugar Cane
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil

MMMMM-------------------------NUOC CHAM------------------------------
      1    Clove garlic
    1/2    Fresh hot red chili pepper
           -or 2 dried
      2 ts Heaping, granulated sugar
    1/8    Fresh lime
      2 tb Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  2 1/2 tb Water, more if necessary
 
  Here we have a party dish that will bring out "oohs" and "ahs" from
  your guests on sight - and a repeat performance on taste.
  
  Crab claws, alone, are sometimes available in fish stores. If they
  aren't, boil several hard shell crabs and use the claws; you can use
  the bodies in many other dishes.
  
  The crab claws in fish stores are already partially peeled and serve
  not only as a handle but are edible as well. If you prepare your own
  claws, peel the upper section around which you mold the shrimp paste.
  
  Boil the crab legs or crabs for about 10 minutes, then drain and cool;
  remove the claws from the crabs, if using, and reserve the bodies for
  another purpose.
  
  Have the shrimp paste ready; preheat the oven to 350F.
  
  Pour the oil into a bowl.  Dip your fingers into the oil and pick up 2
  tablespoons of the shrimp paste. Mold it into an oval around and
  halfway down the crab claw, covering the part of the claw where it
  was attached to the body; this will leave a claw tip extended to
  serve as a handle. Place the claws on a baking sheet and bake in the
  preheated oven for 30 minutes.
  
  Serve with Nuoc Cham and watercress.
  
  NOTE:  In Vietnam, this dish is always barbecued over charcoal. If
  you wish to prepare it this way, cook for 10 minutes on each side.
  
  Makes 10 servings.

  NUOC CHAM:
  
  This exciting sauce is almost always served at Vietnamese meals, just
  a Westerners serve salt and pepper. It's base is nuoc mam (bottled
  fish sauce). Freshly prepared, it is a constant delight, and so
  addictive to Western palettes that it will appear with meals other
  than Vietnamese. To best appreciate the results of its superb
  blending qualities at the table, use it sparingly at first, gradually
  adding more until the result is just right for your palate.
  
  Peel the garlic.  Split the chili pepper down the center and remove
  the seeds and membrane.  Cut into pieces and put into a mortar,
  together with the garlic and sugar. Pound into a paste. Squeeze the
  lime juice into the paste, then with a small knife remove the pulp
  from the lime section and add it as well. Mash this mixture and add
  the fish sauce and water.
  
  NOTE:  If you find this a trifle strong at first, dilute it with an
  additional 1/2 tablespoon of water.

      1 ds MSG (optional)
      2 tb Mixed chopped fresh
           -coriander (Chinese parsley)
           Scallion green
 
  An excellent way to get twice the pleasure out of your fish purchase.
  You can use either the fish head of the fish carcass if you wish. To
  the people of the South, this is as much their traditional dish as
  Southern Fried Chicken is to our southerners++and it will meet with
  instant praise
  
  Sprinkle the scallions, black pepper, 1 teaspoon salt, and 4
  teaspoons fish sauce over the fish head.  Allow to stand for 10 to 15
  minutes.
  
  Bring 1 quart of water to a boil and drop in the sour bamboo and
  pineapple slices.  Cook at a lively boil for 5 minutes. Drop fish
  head into the actively boiling water and, keeping at a boil, add the
  2 tablespoons fish sauce, remaining teaspoon salt, and a dash of MSG.
  Boil the fish head for a total of 10 minutes. Transfer to a soup
  tureen, sprinkle on the coriander and scallion green, and serve.
  
  NOTE:  If the fish head is dropped into water that is not boiling, it
  will fall apart.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

 Categories: Vietnam, Soups/stews, Beef/veal
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      1    Stalk fresh lemon grass or
      1 tb Dried Lemon Grass
           Sprinkling of freshly
           -ground black pepper
      2 ts Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
      1    Clove garlic, chopped
      6 oz Fatty beef chuck, sliced
           -paper thin
      1 ts Vegetable oil
      2    Shallots or white part of 2
           -scallions, sliced
      3 c  Water
  1 1/2    Beef bouillon cubes
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Fresh coriander (Chinese
           -parsley), chopped
      2    Scallions, green part only,
           -chopped
 
  Here's a pretty simple Vietnamese beef soup recipe in contrast to the
  recipe for Hanoi Beef Soup.  It doesn't call for hot chilies, but you
  can slice a couple into thin rounds and toss 'em in. That's kosher
  (if that term can apply...) with any Vietnamese soup. Add 'em either
  when the soup is brought to it's final boil or just after it's
  removed from the heat.
  
  If you are using fresh lemon grass, simply remove the outer leaves and
  upper two-thirds of the stalk, then chop. If you are using dried, it
  must be soaked for 2 hours, then drained and chopped fine.
  
  Sprinkle the black pepper, 1 teaspoon of the fish sauce, and chopped
  garlic over the meat; mix well and allow the meat to absorb the
  flavors for a few minutes.
  
  Heat the oil and fry the shallots over a high flame. Add the lemon
  grass and fry for about 1 minute, then add the meat. Cook until all
  traces of redness are gone. Add the water, bring to a boil, and add
  the beef bouillon cubes, remaining 1 teaspoon fish sauce, and salt.
  Immediately before serving, bring the soup to a boil. Pour into bowls
  and sprinkle with the chopped coriander and scallion.

      Title: CANNED APPLE CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Preserves, Fruits, Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    2/3 c  Shortening
    1/2 ts Baking powder
  3 1/3 c  Sugar
      2 ts Baking soda
      4    Eggs
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Applesauce
      1 ts Cinnamon (ground)
  3 1/3 c  Flour
      1 ts Cloves (ground)
      1 c  Raisins
    1/2 c  Pecans (chopped)
 
  Grease 8 WIDE-MOUTH pint canning jars with melted shortening. Use a
  brush and avoid getting grease on the jar rims. Cream shortening and
  sugar. Beat in eggs and applesauce. Sift together the dry ingredients
  and blend them into the applesauce mixture.  Add the raisins and nuts
  and divide the batter evenly between 8 widemouth pint jars. The jars
  will be more than half full.  Bake open jars about 60 minutes in an
  oven at 325 degrees. When done, quickly remove one hot jar at a time
  and clean its sealing edge. Immediately apply and firmly tighten a
  two-piece wide-mouth canning lid. The lid will form a vacuum seal as
  the jar cools. Jars of cooled bread may be stored on the pantry shelf
  with other canned foods or may be placed in a freezer.  The bread is
  safe to eat as long as jars remain vacuum sealed and free of mold
  growth.
  
  NOTE: The lady who contributed this recipe to the magazine noted that
  she had some of this cake that is one year old and is still
  delicious. I have personally made this and have several jars that are
  still good over 5 months later.  I plan to save one jar from my
  original batch and see how long it will keep. (Nancy)

 Categories: Desserts, Canned
      Yield: 1 Servings

  I have a few more recipes but no time to upload them right now, I'll
  do that later on this evening. BTW, ANY cake can be baked in canning
  jars. I usually try one jar first--you have to know how much volume
  each recipe will give you. I usually fill ONE jar 1/2 full then bake
  it to see how high it rises. You don't want the cake to come out of
  the top of the jar, only to within 1/4 to 1/2 inch from the lip of
  the jar. Once you've established how high the cake rises, you can go
  from there. The first time around is a bit tricky because you won't
  know how many jars you'll need. MOST of the recipes I've tried I end
  up using around 8. Sterilize as many jars as you think you'll need
  and go from there. Also, the baking times will vary--the moistness of
  each cake recipe will determine the time. Again, MOST of the recipes
  I've tried bake in 35-40 minutes. Start checking the cakes at 30
  minutes and go from there. YES, the cakes DO slide easily out of the
  jars IF you use the jars I listed. They're Ball Quilted Crystal
  Canning Jars (#14400-81400). They can be found at most grocery stores
  (at least here in California) next to the pectin and other canning
  supplies. Also, I've seen the 12 oz straight-sided (plain) jars (# ?)
  at Smart & Final. The plain jars work fine too but they're not as
  pretty and you have to make your own labels--the jars I use come with
  decorative labels. One IMPORTANT tip--get your jars NOW! Once
  summer's over with they're very hard to find. Also, when you can, ask
  for the jars back, they're NOT cheap. Most folks don't mind returning
  them though, they usually want refills! <G> Make sure your LIDS are
  new, the rings don't have to be As the jars do seal, the cakes are as
  moist as the day you put them into the jars--sometimes MORESO. There
  will be a little condensation on the lids and some in the jars so
  when you seal them it's trapped inside. Don't worry about getting the
  water off of the lids before placing them onto the jars, the added
  moisture doesn't hurt the cakes in the slightest. I'm trying to
  address every question that's been asked of me before, I HOPE I've
  done that. If I've missed anything or if anyone has any questions,
  don't hesitate to ask. These make WONDERFUL Christmas gifts and you
  can start NOW! Single friends really appreciate these because each
  jar makes enough for one or two people.

      Title: CANNED FOODS FOR SPECIAL DIETS
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  The cost of commercially canned special diet food often prompts
  interest in preparing these products at home. Some low-sugar and
  low-salt foods may be easily and safely canned at home. However the
  color, flavor and texture of these foods may be different than
  expected and be less acceptable.
  
  CANNING WITHOUT SUGAR
  
  In canning regular fruits without sugar, it is very important to
  select fully ripe but firm fruits of the best quality. Prepare these
  as described for hot-packs for each fruit, but use water or regular
  unsweetened fruit juices instead of sugar syrup. (For more
  information see additional publications for individual fruits.) Juice
  made from the fruit being canned is best. Blends of unsweetened
  apple, pineapple, and white grape juice are also good for filling
  over solid fruit pieces. Adjust headspaces and lids and use the
  processing recommendations given for regular fruits. Add sugar
  substitutes, if desired, when serving.
  
  CANNING WITHOUT SALT (REDUCED SODIUM)
  
  To can tomatoes, vegetables, meats, poultry, and seafood, follow the
  normal procedures for canning, but omit the salt. In these products,
  salt seasons the food but is not necessary to ensure its safety. Add
  salt substitutes, if desired, when serving.

      Title: CANNELLONI 1
 Categories: Italian, Pasta, Chicken
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lb Cannelloni Noodles
      2 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Onions, Chopped Fine
    1/4 lb Mushrooms, Chopped
      1 c  Spinach, Cooked
      2 c  Chicken (white meat)
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
           Salt
           Pepper
    3/4 c  Ricotta
      2 tb Cream
 
  There are many fillings for Cannelloni and there are easily as many
  sauces. Here is one combination:
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Saute the onions and mushrooms in
  butter. Mince the chicken meat, chop the spinach. Add to the onions
  and mushrooms along with nutmeg, salt and pepper. Simmer about 5
  minutes. Allow to cool slightly. Add the Ricotta and cream. Mix
  thoroughly and season to taste. Cook the noodles, 3 at a time, in
  boiling salted water until al dente. Remove using a skimmer and blot
  dry, inside and out. Fill each noodle tube with a heaping tablespoon
  of the filling and place, seam side down, in a buttered, oven proof
  dish. When all the cannelloni are in the pan, cover with a generous
  amount of Italian style tomato sauce, some ground fresh basil and
  melted butter. Sprinkle on some grated parmesan cheese or a thin
  layer of mozzarella. Bake about ten minutes. Serve at once with
  additional sauce and grated parmesan cheese.

      Title: CANNOLI ALLA SICILIANA
 Categories: Desserts, Italian, Cheese
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           Shells:
      2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 tb Shortening
      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Wine, Marsala, Burgundy or
           -Chablis
           Vegetable Oil
           Filling:
      3 c  Ricotta
    1/2 c  Confectioners sugar
    1/4 c  Cinnamon
    1/2    Square unsweetened
           Chocolate grated OR
    1/2 tb Cocoa (both optional)
    1/2 ts Vanilla
      3 tb Citron peel, chopped
      3 tb Orange peel, candied,chopped
      6    Glace cherries, cut up
 
  To make cannoli shells it is necessary to have 3 or 4 metal tubes,
  preferably made from very light tin, about 7-inches long and 1 1/8
  inches in diameter.  The edges should not be soldered. (Old aluminum
  chairs cut up work great)
  
  SHELLS: Combine flour, shortening, sugar and salt, and wetting
  gradually with wine, knead together with fingers until rather hard
  dough or paste is formed. Form into ball, cover with cloth and let
  stand about 1 hour. Cut dough in half and roll half of dough into a
  thin sheet about 1/4 inch thick.  Cut into 4 inch squares. Place a
  metal tube diagonally across each square from one point to another,
  wrapping dough around tube by overlapping the two points and sealing
  overlapping points with a little egg white. Meanwhile heat vegetable
  oil in large deep pan for deep frying. Drop one or two tubes at a
  time into hot oil. Fry gently until dough is a golden brown color.
  Remove from pan, let cool and gently remove shell from metal tube.
  Set shells aside to cool.   Repeat procedure until all shells are
  made.
  
  FILLING: Mix ricotta thoroughly with sifted dry ingredients. Add
  vanilla and fruit peel.  Mix and blend well. (A little grated
  pistachio may be added if desired). Chillin refrigerator before
  filling shells. Fill cold cannoli shells; smooth filling evenly at
  each end of shell. Decorate each end with a piece of glace cherry and
  sprinkle shells with confectioners sugar. Refrigerate until ready to
  serve.
  
  These are best if they are filled just before you company arrives.

           -commercial forms are not
           -found)
           Fat for deep frying
           ****FILLING****
      2 c  Ricotta cheese; as fresh
           -as possible
    1/2 c  Superfine sugar
    1/4 c  Candied fruit; citron,
           -orange peel, etc., finely
           -diced
    1/4 c  Pistachio nuts; coarsely
           -chopped
    1/4 c  Semi-sweet chocolate; cut in
           -fine dice (optional)
      1 ts Vanilla extract OR
           Orange flower water;
           -optional
 
  Sift the flour and salt into a bowl, make a well in the center, and
  add the wine and sugar.  Work the flour into the center until you
  have a rather firm dough, something like noodle dough. If the dough
  is too crumbly add more wine, but do not let it become sticky. Place
  dough on a lightly floured pastry cloth or board and knead it and
  pound it vigorously for about 15 minutes.  It should be perfectly
  smooth by then. Form it into a ball, wrap in a clean, slightly
  dampened cloth, and let it rest for 2 hours.  When it has rested,
  roll it out on the pastry cloth or board until very thin (no more
  than 1/16 inch). Cut it into 5-inch squares and roll it around the
  metal tubes as follows: take a square and place it before you diamond
  fashion; one of the points toward you. Place the tube vertically
  across the middle of the diamond, each end at a point of the dough.
  Fold the sides over the tube, moistening the overlap with a little
  water and pressing together.  When all the squares have been thus
  rolled, place them, a few at a time, into deep fat preheated to 375
  degrees F. Remove them when they are golden brown (tongs are best for
  this, as the rolls are fragile) and let them drain on absorbent
  paper. When they are cool, slip off the tubes, and fill with the
  ricotta filling.
  
  Press the ricotta through a fine sieve into a bowl. Beat it until it
  is creamy and smooth.  Beat in the rest of the ingredients with a
  large fork. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tube (or
  merely use the nozzle, without a tube) and pipe the filling into the
  cooled shells. Makes 12 cannoli.  Source: Great Italian Cooking by

      Title: CANTONESE BARBECUE PORK
 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    To 3 1/2 pounds pork butt,
           -shoulder or tenderloin
      4 tb Soy sauce
      5 tb Sugar
      3 tb Honey
      2 tb Hoisin sauce
      1 tb Grated fresh ginger
      1 tb Shao Hsing rice wine or dry
           -sherry
  1 1/2 ts Salt
           Mustard Dip (recipe follows)
      3 tb Toasted sesame seeds
 
  Think of these sweet, glazed strips of roast pork as the ham of Asia.
  Both Chinese and Southeast Asian cooks serve cha siu as a main dish,
  or as a meat addition or a delicious garnish in many stir-fry
  mixtures, soups, noodle dishes and fried rice.  Most Chinese cooks
  purchase their cha siu already prepared at a roasting shop
  (delicatessen). However, it is very easy to make at home, and the
  results are not as garishly red as some commercial versions made with
  food coloring.
  
  Remove and discard the excess fat from the pork.  Cut pork lengthwise
  (with the grain) into 2-inch wide strips 5 to 6 inches long. Put into
  a large bowl.
  
  Combine soy sauces, sugar, honey, hoisin, ginger, wine and salt. Pour
  over meat and rub it in well.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator
  at least overnight or for up to 3 days, turning several times.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350F.
  
  Place the pork strips on a broiler pan lined with foil. Roast for 30
  minutes, turning once halfway through. Increase the heat to 425F and
  roast for 10 minutes longer. Let cool before slicing.
  
  To serve, cut across the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices. Serve with
  mustard and sesame seeds for dipping.
  
  MUSTARD DIP:
  
  Mix together 2 tablespoons Colman's mustard, 2 tablespoons water,
  pinch of salt, pinch of sugar and a few drops of oil.

           ---------------------------
           -
           -CAPITOL LUNCH CHILI SAUCE
 
  1 lb. hamburger 4 green peppers (chopped) 4 onions (chopped) 3 celery
  stalks (chopped) 3 pcs. chopped garlic
  
  Mix hamburger and chopped ingredients in a saucepan. Add app. 3 cups
  of water.  Cook slowly until mixture begins to thicken.
  
  When  it thickens, add 3 tablespoons of chili powder, then add salt
  and pepper to suit your taste.
  
  The  secret of this sauce is that you must cook it S-L-O-W-L-Y (3-4
  hrs.), stirring often.
  
  When  finished cooking, add 3 tablespoons of dried mustard and stir in
  well.   For best results, use hot dogs with the "skin" on them
  (Capitol Lunches  the Martin Rosol's brand). Put the hot dog on a
  FRESH roll, spread on some fresh mustard,  fresh  chopped onion,
  spread on the sauce, and ENJOY!
  
  (Note:  This recipe makes a LOT of sauce, as you can imagine, since
  the quantities are for use in a restaurant. Use smaller amounts of all
  ingredients to suit your needs.) Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40

MMMMM---------------------FOR COOKING WATER--------------------------
      1 tb Oil
 
  Combine 4 eggs, 2 teaspoons oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt in bowl and
  whisk until well blended. Add flour, a little at a time, beating
  after each addition. Turn out onto well-floured board and knead
  several minutes until dough is firm and smooth but not dry. Add more
  flour if necessary to prevent sticking. Cover and let stand at
  slightly warm temperature about 30 minutes to ripen. Cut dough in
  2-inch portions and roll out slightly to flatten enough to fit into
  pasta machine. Roll in machine starting with thickest setting and
  progressing to next to finest setting until pasta is very thin
  (expansion takes place during cooking). Continue until all dough is
  rolled into strips. Place strips on floured board and sprinkle
  lightly with flour. Cut in 4-inch squares and let rest 10 minutes
  before filling and cooking. Meanwhile, to make sauce, saute onion and
  garlic in olive oil until golden. Add undrained tomatoes, basil and 2
  teaspoons salt. Season with pepper to taste. Bring to boil and simmer
  15 minutes. Add sugar at last minute. To make filling, combine
  ricotta, drained spinach, nutmeg, 4 eggs and Parmesan to taste in
  bowl and mix well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring large
  pot of generously salted water to boil. Add 1 tablespoon oil. Drop
  each piece of pasta into boiling water and cook 3 to 4 minutes, or
  just until pasta floats to surface. Remove at once and plunge into
  bowl filled with ice water 1 minute. Drain pasta on clean cloth to
  prevent sticking. Place 1 tablespoon filling in center of each pasta
  square. Fold square into triangle, then again into smaller triangle.
  Press edges to seal. Pour layer of tomato sauce in large baking pan.
  Arrange cappellacci in rows, slightly overlapping. Cover with
  remaining sauce and sprinkle with additional Parmesan cheese. Bake at
  400F 5 to 7 minutes.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
     12 sl French bread, crusts removed
      2 ts Butter
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Apple juice
      1 oz Butter
    1/2 c  Raisins
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      6 oz Cream cheese
    1/4 c  Pecan pieces
      1 ts Cinnamon
      1 c  Whipping cream
      2 tb Powdered sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla
 
  This recipe is a combination of one given to me by the Santa Fe
  School of Cooking and one tasted at the Border Grill in Los Angeles.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9 x 13 inch baking dish. Tear
  bread into bite-sized pieces and place in baking dish.
  
  Toast in oven for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, over medium high heat, stir
  the sugar continuously in a saucepan until it melts and turns a light
  caramel color. Immediately add the water and apple juice.
  
  Be careful; the caramel will bubble and splatter. Do not bend over
  the pan when you do this! The caramel will partially solidify but
  will liquefy again as you heat it. Add the butter and raisins. When
  caramel is completely liquefied, remove from heat and stir in the
  vanilla.
  
  Pour mixture over the bread pieces in the baking dish. Make sure all
  of the bread is well soaked with caramel. Place tablespoons of the
  cream cheese throughout the bread. Sprinkle the top with pecans and
  cinnamon.
  
  Bake at 350 degrees F. for 20 to 26 minutes, or until all but a
  little of the caramel at the bottom of the dish is ab sorbed.
  
  Lightly whip the cream. Add the sugar and vanilla. Serve the pudding
  warm with the sweetened cream.
  
  Note: You may add a peeled, chopped apple or pear to the pudding
  before it is baked.

 Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------KAREN PHILLIPS CBTX40A------------------------
  1 1/4 lb Medium bananas; unpeeled
      2 c  Half-and-half
  1 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      6    Egg yolks
    1/8 ts Lemon juice
      1 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
      2 c  Heavy cream
 
  EQUIPMENT: Measuring cup, measuring spoons, 2 stainless steel bowls (1
  large), slotted spoon, film wrap, 2 1/2-qt saucepan, whisk, electric
  mixer with paddle, rubber spatula, instant-read test thermometer,
  ice-cream freezer, 2-qt plastic container with lid
  
  Peel the bananas. Using a slotted spoon, smash them to a
  rough-textured consistency in a stainless steel bowl. Cover with film
  wrap and set aside.
  
  Place 1/2 cup of sugar and the lemon juice in a 2 1/2-qt saucepan.
  Stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will resemble moist sand).
  Caramelize the sugar for 5 to 6 minutes over medium-high heat,
  stirring constantly with a whisk to break up any lumps (the sugar
  will first turn clear as it liquefies, then light brown as it
  caramelizes). Reduce the heat to medium.
  
  Carefully and slowly pour the heavy cream, then the half-and-half
  into the caramelized sugar (the mixture will steam and boil rapidly
  as the cream is added). Add 1/2 cup of sugar and whisk to dissolve.
  Bring to a boil, about 5 minutes.

      Title: CARAMEL BRIE
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 38 Servings
 
      1    Wheel Brie - (60% butterfat
           -- about 2.8 pounds)
      2 c  Sugar - granulated
    1/2 c  Water
     16    Walnut halves - or pecan
           -halves (12 - 16 optional)
 
  Number of Servings:  38
  
  Put the Brie on a rack over a large sheet of parchment paper or
  aluminum foil. Combine sugar and water in a heavy saucepan and melt
  the sugar, swirling the pan from time to time. Do not stir. When the
  mixture
  
  begins to boil, cover the pan to allow condensation to drip back down
  and melt the crystallized sugar on the side of the pan. Uncover the
  pan after 3 to 5 minutes and continue cooking over high heat until
  sugar becomes a deep golden color.  The temperature of the caramel
  should be hard crack, 300F. Immediately pour the caramel over the
  cheese to cover the top evenly, allowing the excess to drip down the
  sides. You may have to tilt the cheese a little to spread the caramel
  evenly. Be very careful not to touch the hot caramel. Press nuts
  around the perimeter, if desired. The caramel will harden quickly.
  Serve within an hour. Present the cheese with small cheese knifes.
  The guests will have to crack through the caramel coating, but this
  is part of the fun of eating such an unusual treat.
  
  NOTE:  When working with melted sugar or caramel, always keep a bowl
  of ice water nearby. If you should burn yourself, plunge the burned
  area into the water.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Sugar
      1 pn Cream of tartar
           Aluminum foil
      6 oz Ladle
           Vegetable oil
           Candy thermometer
 
  Cover the outside (rounded part) of a 6 oz ladle with aluminum foil.
  Making sure to keep the surface smooth and tight. Lightly oil the
  domed surface of foil.
  
  Now pour into a saucepan the sugar, water and cream of tartar. Shake
  the pan to mix and cover. Heat this covered mixture over medium low
  heat until the sugar dissolves. Remove lid and continue cooking the
  syrp until it turns a light gold color (about 340 degrees F. on candy
  thermometer).
  
  Remove the pan from the heat and let sit at room temperature for 6-8
  minutes. The syrup will turn a darker gold color.
  
  Now you are ready to make the cages. Just hold the foil covered ladle
  over the pan, dip a spoon into the caramel mixture and drizzle over
  ladle, moving you hand around in a swirling motion to form a wed or
  lattice pattern on the foil. Prop up the ladle so the caramel cage
  cools completely (about 10 minutes).
  
  Pry foil away from the ladle carefully so as not to break the fragile
  cage. Trim away the uneven strands with scissors to form a nice
  straight bottom. Now carefully peel off the foil and you have a
  beautiful candy cage to place over a single scoop of ice cream. Try
  to find a dish so the cage fits on the edge of the dish. Instruct
  your guests to tap the cage with the back of a spoon and enjoy the
  special effect.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Water
           FOR THE CUSTARD:
      3    Eggs
      3    Egg yolks
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 ts Vanilla
  1 1/2 c  Milk
  1 1/2 c  Half and half
 
  FOR THE CARAMEL: Heat the oven to 375F. For the caramel, combine the
  sugar and water in a small saucepan. Swirl the pan until the sugar is
  dissolved, then cover the pan and cook over medium high heat until
  thick and large bubbles form. Uncover the pan, and cook until a rich,
  brown color. Watch the caramel, since it burns very quickly once it
  begins to color. Pour the syrup into the bottom of a mold, and rotate
  to cover the bottom and up a few inches of the sides evenly. Set
  aside. For the custard, whisk the eggs, yolks and sugar in a mixing
  bowl. Heat the vanilla, milk and half and half until hot to the
  touch, about 150F. Slowly add this to the egg mixture, and pour into
  the prepared mold. Place the mold in a baking pan, and place in the
  oven. Pour boiling water into the baking pan so it is half way up the
  sides of mold. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until a kniefe inserted
  in the center comes out cleam. Cool at room temperature, then
  refrigerate and serve chilled. To serve, invert the mold over a
  platter with sides to catch the caramel sauce. Note: The custard can
  be made up to two days in advance. If made in advance, refrigerate,
  covered with plastic wrap.

 Categories: Chinese, Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  All purpose flour
      2 tb Cornstarch
    3/4 ts Baking powder
    1/2 c  Water
      2    Golden Delicious apples -or-
      2    Bananas
           Salad oil
    2/3 c  Granulated sugar
    1/3 c  Warm water
      1 tb Salad oil
      2 ts Sesame seeds
 
  In a bowl, mix flour, cornstarch, and baking powder. Add water and
  stir until smooth.  Peel and core apples; cut each apple into 3
  wedges. (If you use bananas, peel and cut in 1/2 inch thick diagonal
  slices.) Place fruit in batter and turn to coat evenly. Into a deep
  pan pour oil to a depth of about 1 1/2 inches. Heat oil to 350
  degrees. Using chopsticks or a spoon, lift one piece of fruit at a
  time from batter and let excess batter drip off, then lower fruit
  into hot oil. Cook several pieces at a time until coating is golden
  brown (about 2 minutes). Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on
  paper towels. Generously oil a flat serving dish. Fill a serving bowl
  to the brim with ice cubes; cover with water. Place sugar, water and
  oil in a ten inch frying pan; stir to blend. Place pan over high
  heat. When mixture begins to bubble (about one minute), shake pan
  continuously to prevent burning.  Continue cooking and shaking pan
  until syrup *just* turns a pale straw color (about 9 minutes).
  Immediately remove from heat, add sesame seeds, and swirl to mix.
  (Syrup will continue to cook after you remove it from heat and color
  will turn golden in a few seconds.) Drop fruit into syrup and swirl
  to coat evenly. Using two spoons, immediately remove each piece of
  fruit and place on oiled dish so pieces do not touch. At table, dip
  each piece of fruit in ice water so coating hardens and fruit cools.
  Serve.

  mixture over medium heat. Continue melting sugar in skillet, stirring
  and watching closely so it does not scorch. As soon as it is
  completely melted, por liquid sugar in a thin stream into boiling
  sugar-cream mixture, stirring constantly. Do not let sugar remain
  over heat after completely melted; this will produced a scorched
  taste. Cook com- bined mixtures to 246 degrees F. Remove from heat
  and add baking soda and butter. Stir in and let candy stand for 30
  minutes. Add nuts. Stir to mix; pour into buttered 9-inch square
  pans. Cool slightly and cut into squares. Makes about 78 pieces.

      Title: CARAMEL NUT FROSTING
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      3 c  Sugar
      2 tb Light cane syrup (or corn
           -syrup
      1 c  Heavy cream
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/4 lb Butter (1 stick)
  1 1/2 c  Chopped pecans
 
  Place 1-1/2 cups of the sugar into a heavy saucepan, taking care that
  no crystals cling to the sides of the pan. Add syrup. Add cream by
  pouring down the sides of the pan to wash away any crystals that may
  have collected there. Place sauce pan over medium heat and stir as
  sugar melts. When mixture boils, place remaining sugar in a heavy
  saute pan (preferably cast iron) over medium heat and stir until
  sugar melts and turns golden brown. DO NOT LET SUGAR BURN OR IT WILL
  TASTE BITTER. Add browned sugar to the mixture in the saucepan. Stir
  and cook until mixture reaches the soft ball stage (240 deg).  Add
  vanilla and pour mixture over chunked butter in a mixing bowl. Let
  cool for about 5 minutes, then beat vigourously until frosting
  reaches spreading consistency. Add chopped pecans. Frost top of each
  layer, stacking one upon the other, then frost side of cake. Freezes
  well [but *I'll* never know]. ** The secret of success with this
  frosting is in the sugar. After the ingredients have reached the
  proper temperature, no sugar crystals can be introduced into the
  liquid, else the frosting will be grainy instead of smooth and creamy.

      Title: CARAMEL POWDER
 Categories: Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Free Flow Recipe
 
  For years one of my favorite things has been the sheets of "caramel"
  that resulted when I baked a ham and the glazing ran down onto the
  foil lined baking pan, then set up. Never occurred to me to use it in
  a recipe, but it did to someone at Sunset Magazine.  The illustration
  in the magazine shows the flan garnished with crunched up chunks of
  the un powdered caramel.
  
  Line a 10- by 15-inch baking pan with a single sheet of foil, folding
  up at edges.
  
  Pour 2 cups sugar into a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan, place
  over medium-high heat. Shake pan often until most of the sugar
  liquefies, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; tilt pan to mix
  hot caramel with sugar until all is melted and the color is deep
  amber, 3 to 5 ea minutes.
  
  Immediately pour hot caramel into foil-lined pan. Using hot pads to
  protect hands (mixture is very hot), tilt pan to spread caramel in
  thin layer. Set aside until hard and completely cool, about 30
  minutes.
  
  When cool, lift foil from pan; peel foil from caramel. Break caramel
  into chunks.  To make powder, whirl chunks in a blender or food
  processor fitted with metal blade (container must be completely dry).

  EQUIPMENT: 2 1/2-qt saucepan, whisk, stainless steel bowl, 9 x 3-inch
  springform pan, electric mixer with paddle, rubber spatula, red
  toothpick, 10-inch plate, serrated slicer, large 100%-cotton kitchen
  towel, cake spatula Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. To prepare the
  caramel flavoring, combine the granulated sugar and lemon juice in a
  2 1/2-qt saucepan and stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will
  resemble moist sand). Caramelize the sugar for 5 to 6 minutes over
  medium-high heat, stirring constantly to break up any lumps (the
  sugar will first turn clear as it liquefies, then brown as it
  caramelizes). Remove the saucepan from the heat and carefully add the
  heavy cream; stir to combine (the mixture will steam and boil rapidly
  as the cream is added). Transfer the caramel to a stainless steel
  bowl and allow to cool to room temperature. Continued >>>

      Title: CARAMEL SAUCE (RAUTHIER)
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/3 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish
           -sauce)
      4    Shallots, thinly sliced
           Freshly ground pepper
 
  Thought your reference to cooking sugar syrup to "caramelize" it was
  interesting.  It reminded me of a sauce that's used in Vietnamese
  cuisine. It's used in a variety of recipes and turns out to be the
  "secret" ingredient that gives barbecued Vietnamese stuff that unique
  taste when used as a marinade for strips of beef, chicken or pork. I
  use it in Satay recipes. The result is a subtle, delicious taste. It
  also gives a nice glazed finish to stuff.  Its use shouldn't be
  limited to Asian cuisine. In fact, I suspect that this is originally
  a French influence...
  
  "...the only rule to remember is to turn off the smoke alarm and open
  all the windows, as the sauce will smoke heavily, with a pungent
  smell." [I didn't find this to be much of a problem. S.C..] Cook the
  sugar in a small heavy saucepan over low heat, swirling the pan
  constantly, until brown. It will smoke slightly. Immediately remove
  the pan from the heat and stir the fish sauce into the caramel, being
  careful to guard against splattering (the mixture will bubble
  vigorously).
  
  Return the mixture to low heat and gently boil, swirling the pan
  occasionally, until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 3
  minutes. Add the shallots and ground pepper to taste; stir to
  combine. Use in recipes where required.  [Or, as I noted, as a
  marinade for BBQ stuff. S.C..]
  
  NOTE:  Cool this sauce thoroughly before using.  If cold food is
  added to a caramel sauce that is hot, the sugar will harden instantly
  and you'll end up with a dish full of candy chips.
  
  Yield: 1/3 cup.

    1/2 c  Icing sugar
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine
    1/4 c  Corn syrup (dark is best)
      1 ts Unflavored gelatin
    2/3 c  Sweetened condensed milk
 
  An upside down toffee-like confection.
  
  First Layer: Measure first 3 ingredients into bowl. Crumble together
  well. Press in ungreased 8 x 8-inch pan. Bake in 350 F oven for 20 to
  25 minutes. Cool.
  
  Second Layer: Melt the scond amount of butter and corn syrup in heavy
  saucepan. Measure sugar in cup. Stir in gelatin to mix thoroughly.
  Add to saucepan stirring to dissolve. Add condensed milk. Stir,
  bringing to a boil. Boil 4 minutes stirring constantly. It burns very
  easily when boiling. Remove from heat. Beat with spoon until it
  thickens and gets blobby. You will need to take a moment's rest now
  and then as you beat. Pour over first layer. Chill overnight. Invert
  on plastic wrap. This makes it much easier to cur through to the
  bottom. Cut into 25 squares.

 Categories: Desserts, Candies
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           -Dorothy Cross TMPJ72B
      1    Stick (4 ozs) butter;
           -cut into 8 pieces
    1/3 c  Sugar
      2 ts Vanilla extract
  1 1/3 c  Flour
      1    Egg
  1 1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
           -(9 ozs)
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
    1/3 c  Heavy cream
      1 pk (14 oz.) vanilla caramels
      3 c  Chopped pecans
 
     Preheat oven to 400 degrees. To make crust, in a food processor,
  combine butter, sugar, and vanilla. Process 1 minute. Add flour and
  process to blend. With machine on, add egg through feed tube, and
  process just until dough forms and leaves sides of bowl.
     Press dough evenly into bottom and all the way up sides of an
  11-inch fluted metal tart pan with a removable bottom. Press a sheet
  of foil on top of crust and line with pie weights or dried beans.
  Bake 10 minutes. Remove foil and weights and bake 5 to 7 minutes
  longer, or until golden. Let cool.
     Meanwhile, prepare truffle mixture. In a 1-quart glass bowl,
  combine chocolate chips and 1/3 cup cream. Heat in a microwave oven
  on High 1 to 1-1/4 minutes, or until chocolate is melted and smooth
  when stirred. When crust is cool, spread three-quarters of truffle
  mixture evenly over bottom of crust. Refrigerate 15 minutes, or until
  truffle mixture is set.
     In a large skillet, combine caramels and remaining 1/2 cup cream.
  Heat over medium-low heat, stirring often, until caramels are melted
  and mixture is smooth, about 3 minutes. Stir in pecans. Spread evenly
  over chilled truffle mixture.
     Heat remaining chocolate truffle mixture in microwave oven on High
  15 to 20 seconds, if necessary, to melt. Drizzle with a fork over top
  of tart. Refrigerate until filling is set, at least 1 hour. Before
  serving, remove side of pan, and using a sharp knife, cut tart into
  slices.
  
  COMMENTS: This caramel tart, which tastes almost like a piece of
  candy, is a breeze to prepare with store-bought caramels. Pile the
  caramel-pecan mixture on top of a chocolate truffle mixture spread on
  a butter cookie crust.

        1    Recipe Quick Puff Pastry
  :          -(Recipe Follows)
        1    Northern Spy, Or
  :          Other Firm Baking Apple
      1/4 c  Sugar
        2 TB Unsalted Butter
        1 TB Calvados -- french apple
  :          brandy
  
  On a lightly floured work surface, roll out an eighth of quick puff
  pastry dough recipe to about 1/8 inch thickness. Using a sharp
  parking knife, cut dough into a circle about 7 1/2 inches in
  diameter. Transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet, and place in
  refrigerator to chill about 15 minutes. Heat oven to 425F. Place the
  chilled pastry dough in a heavy cast iron skillet that measure 6 1/2
  inches in diameter at the bottom. Peel, core and slice the apple in
  half lengthwise. Using a mandoline or very sharp knife, slice apple
  halves, widthwise into twenty five 1/8 inch slices. Arrange the
  slices in a neat fanned pattern, overlapping he apples, keeping them
  1/2 inch in from the edge of the pastry dough, fill in the center
  with smaller or broken apple slices as you create the fanned out
  circle. Sprinkle two tablespoons sugar over the apples, and dot with
  1 tablespoon butter, cut into very small pieces. Place skillet in the
  oven, and bake until the pstry has puffed up along the edges of te
  pan and is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove the skillet from
  the oven. Using a spatula remove the tart from the skillet, and
  transfer to a plate, set aside. Add the remaining tablespoon butter
  to the skillet, and place over medium heat. Add the remaining 2
  tablespoons sugar, and cook until the sugar dissolves and forms a
  light caramel, about 5 minutes. Measure Calvados into a glass then
  pour into the caramel, cook out the alcohol, about 2 to 3 minutes.
  Return the tart to the skillet, apple side down and cook 4 to 5
  minutes, until the caramel bubbles up over the tart, and starts to
  look a litle thick. Remove the skillet from theheat, and carefully
  invert the tart onto a plate large enough to catch the hot caramel as
  it drips out of the skillet.
  
  Quick Puff Pastry Makes 2 lbs
    1 3/4    cup all purpose flour 2 cups cake flour 1 teaspoon salt 2
  cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter, very cold, cut into small pieces 1
  cup to 1 1/4 cups ice water 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
  
  Sift together the all purpose flour, cake flour and salt into a large
  chilled bowl. Cut in the pieces of butter, using a pastry knife until
  the butter is in very small lumps, about 1/2 inch in diameter.
  Combine the ice water and lemon juice, and stir into the flour
  mixture, a little at a time pressing the dough together with your
  hands until it comes together. Turn the dough out onto a well floured
  work surface and roll it into a 1/2 inch thick rough rectangle,
  approximately 12 by 18 inches. The dough will be very crumbly. Fold
  bottomof the rectangle toward the center, then the top of the
  rectangle toward the center, overlapping the bottom third, like a
  letter, and give the dough a quarter turn to the right. Roll the
  dough into a large rectangle, 1/2 inch thick and fold into thirds
  again. This completes the first double turn. Remove any excess flour
  with a wide dry brush.  Repeat rolling, folding, and turning process
  two more times to execute another double turn, refrigerating the
  dough for a few minutes if the butter becomes too warm. Wrap the
  dough in plastic, and put in refrigerator to chill for 1 hour. Remove
  chilled dough from the refrigerator.  Repeat rolling, folding, and
  turning process again to execture one more double turn. There will be
  six turns in all. The dough needsto be rolled out to 1/2 inch thick
  rectangle each time.With each turn, the dough will become smoother
  and easier to handle. Store the dough, wrapped well in plastic in the
  refrigerator for up to 2 days or in the freezer for 3 months.

      Title: CARAMELIZED FENNEL SOUP
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Fennel bulbs; trim/mince
      6 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      4 c  Vegetable or chicken broth
    1/2 c  Whipping cream; opt
           Sea salt; to taste

MMMMM-----------------------BOUQUET GARNI----------------------------
           Fresh rosemary
           Fresh parsley
           Bay leaf
           Fresh thyme
           Tie together with twine
 
  1. Combine fennel and oil in large, heavy-bottomed stockpot. Stir to
  coat fennel with oil. Cook, covered, over low heat 10 minutes,
  stirring occasionally. If fennel burns it will give the soup a bitter
  taste.
  
  2. Remove lid; continue to cook over low heat. Pieces should gradually
  brown and caramelize. Add bouquet garni and broth; simmer; covered, 30
  minutes.
  
  3. Discard bouquet garni. Using an immersion blender, roughly puree
  soup in stockpot. (Alternatively, pass soup through coarse blade of
  food mill or puree coarsely in batches in food processor; and return
  to stockpot.) Soup should be creamy but not totally smooth. Stir in
  cream, if using; reheat. Taste for seasoning. Serve piping hot in
  warmed shallow soup bowls.
  
  NOTE: Fennel has a tough outer skin. It's well worth it to peel it
  with a vegetable peeler.

      Title: CARAMELIZED ONION CONFIT
 Categories: Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6 tb Olive oil
      5 tb Butter
     15    Onions (about 5 pounds),
           -peeled, thinly sliced
      4    Bay leaves
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  White wine
 
  When thin slices of onions are cooked very slowly in butter and olive
  oil they reduce to a dark, thick consistency much like a marmalade.
  
  Combine the olive oil and butter in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan
  over medium heat.  When the butter foams, add half of the sliced
  onions and 2 of the bay leaves.  Sprinkle with half of the sugar and
  half of the salt.
  
  Add remaining onions, bay leaves, sugar and salt. Cover, reduce heat
  to low, and cook for 20 minutes.
  
  Uncover, stir, and increase heat to medium.  Cook for 15 minutes,
  stirring occasionally.
  
  Increase heat to high and cook, stirring constantly, until the onions
  are a deep golden brown, about 10 minutes.
  
  Add the wine and stir, scraping bottom of pan to dislodge any browned
  bits. Cook for 4 or 5 minutes longer. Serve hot or at room
  temperature.
  
  Delicious with roast meats or poultry, as well with leftover turkey
  sandwiches (try topping with a little cranberry sauce).
  
  Makes about 3 cups.

      Title: CARAMELS AU CHOCOLAT (CHOCOLATE CARAMELS)
 Categories: Chocolate, Candies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  Milk
     13 oz Powdered sugar
           Eggsize piece of glucose
  3 1/4 oz Chocolate in tablets
  1 1/2 oz Butter
    1/2    Vanilla bean
 
  Put milk, sugar, vanilla bean and glucose into a stewpan. Put the
  chocolate into a round-bottomed copper pan and melt it slowly on the
  stove. Meanwhile, heat the mixture in the stewpan, not letting it
  boil, since you merely want to melt the sugar and glucose. When
  completely melted, pour this mixture, bit by bit, into the chocolate,
  while stirring. When thoroughly mixed, cook at moderate heat,
  constantly stirring. Cook to the 'ball' stage. (To test the stage of
  cooking by finger, dip the thumb and index finger into cold water,
  then into the mixture, bringing the 2 fingers together and dipping
  them again into water. This should be done quickly to avoid burning.
  The mixture forms a ball that can be rolled with the tip of the
  fingers.) Remove from the fire, add the butter, mix well, and pour
  onto an oiled marble slab in an oiled, iron framework. Let cool and
  cut.

MMMMM--------------------ENGLISH TRANSLATION-------------------------
           Deep-fried Artichokes,
           Jewish Style

MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
      4 sm Artichokes
    1/2    Lemon
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 c  Plain bread crumbs, spread
           -over aluminum foil
           Vegetable oil; for frying
 
  Cut off half of each artichoke stems.  Remove and discard all outer
  green leaves until you reach the white central cone. At this point,
  you will see that three-quarters of the leaves are white and the tip
  of the cone is pale green.  Slice off the green top.
  
  With a small knife, trim off the outer green part of each artichoke's
  green bottom.
  
  Gently open each artichoke with your hands and remove the fuzzy choke
  with a spoon or melon scooper.  Rub the lemon over the cut edges of
  the artichokes and season them inside with salt and pepper. Gently
  open the artichoke leaves as far as they can go without breaking them
  off, and holding the artichokes by their stems, press the open leaves
  into the gread crumbs to coat lightly.
  
  Heat two inches of oil in a medium-size saucepan over medium heat to
  250F to 257F.  Lower the artichokes into the oil and cook about 10
  minutes. Turn the artichokes a few times to they will fry evenly.
  Lower the heat if the artichokes turn golden too fast.  With a thin
  knife, prick thier bottoms to test for doneness. They are done when
  they can be easily pierced. Transfer the artichokes to peper towels
  to drain. (The artichokes can be prepared up to this point severl
  hours ahead.)
  
  Just before you are ready to serve them, pour two inches of oil in
  another medium-size sacuepan over medium-high heat. When the oil is
  very hot, but not smoking, about 375F, carefully add one artichoke.
  With two long wooden spoons, or a long tong, hold the artichoke
  open-face down, pressing the leaves gently against the bottom of the
  pan to open them further. Hold the artichoke in that position for
  about 30 seconds. Transfer the artichoke to peper towels to drain.
  Repeat with the other artichokes. The second frying should take no
  longer than 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle them lightly with salt and serve
  hot.

  then snip off prickly tips. Place artichokes in boiling water with
  lemon juice and let stand for 10 minutes. Remove, pat dry and
  sprinkle insides with salt. Set artichokes stem-down in a deep
  stainless-steel kettle just large enough to hold them snugly. Add

      4 sm Artichokes
    1/2    Lemon
      3    Fresh bread slices, crusts
           -removed, finely chopped
    1/3 c  Chopped fresh parsley
     10    Fresh mint leaves; or
      1 ts -dried mint, crumbled
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/2 c  Olive oil
           Salt; to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  Remove and discard the tougher outer leaves of the artichokes. Cut the
  remaining leaves halfway, with scissors, until you reach the central
  cone of leaves. At this point you will see that three-quarters of the
  leaves are white and the tip of the cone is pale green. Slice off the
  green top.
  
  Gently open the artichokes with your hands and remove the fuzzy
  chokes with a spoon or a melon scooper.  Rub the lemon over the cut
  edges of the artichokes to prevent discoloration.
  
  With a small knife, trim off the outer green part of the artichokes'
  green bottoms.  Trim the stalks, leaving about 2 inches intact. Trim
  away the greener outer part of the stalks, leaving the white part of
  the stalks intact.  Rub the cut edges of the artichokes with more
  lemon.
  
  In a small bowl, combine the bread, parsley, mint, garlic, and oil,
  and season.  Push the stuffing between the artichoke leaves and into
  each artichoke cavity.
  
  Place the artichokes, with their stalks pointing upward, in a small
  casserole.  Add the remaining oil and just enough water to come
  halfway up the artichokes. (If you have any stuffing left, add it to
  the casserole).
  
  Brush a piece of parchment paper with olive oil and place over
  artichokes.
   Cover the casserole with a tight lid and bake at 375F until tender,
  30 to 40 mintues.  Cool to room temperature.
  
  Arrange the artichokes with their stemps upward on a serving dish. If
  there is still quite a bit of watery juice in the casserole, cook it
  down over high heat until you 4 to 5 tablespoons left. Pour the sauce
  over the artichokes, let cool, and serve.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  This is an absolutely no-fuss way to prepare artichokes, yet produces
  a delicious result.  The original Italian recipe on which this is
  based uses three times the amount of oil specified below, but the
  lower-fat version works fine.
  
  Have ready a basin of acidulated water.  Take 4 large artichokes or 8
  small ones and prepare them as described above, cutting them into
  quarters and dropping them into the basin as they are done. Pack the
  artichoke quarters in a single layer into a open pan. Pour over them
  enough boiling water to barely cover the artichokes, add 2
  tablespoons of olive oil and some roughly crushed peppercorns.  Boil
  hard until the water has evaporated, then add the juice of a lemon
  and stir.
  
  Put the artichokes into a serving dish and scatter with chopped
  parsley. They can be served hot or cold.

  outside leaves and the central leaves and the choke, to make cups.
  
  Mix together 100 g of finely chopped ham, 100 g chopped cooked
  chicken, 2 tablespoons of cream (or use evaporated skim milk),
  chopped parsley, salt, pepper and a pinch of nutmeg. Stuff the

      Title: CARCIOFI RIPIENI (STUFFED ARTICHOKES)
 Categories: Appetizers, Italian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 md Artichokes
    1/2    Lemon
      2 c  Soft Bread Crumbs
    3/4 c  Grated Parmesan Cheese
    1/3 c  Chopped Parsley
      2    Cloves Garlic -- chopped
           Salt And Pepper
      6 tb Olive Oil
 
  Wash the artichokes and invert to drain. Cut the stems straight
  across, leavinga level base so the artichokes will stand upright.
  Remove the tough outer leaves at the base and cut about 1/2" off the
  tips of the remaining leaves. With a sharp knife, slice the top of
  the artichokes straight across, taking off about 1". As you trim, rub
  the artichokes with the cut lemon to prevent discoloration. Tap them
  firmly on a hard surface to force the center leaves slightly open.
  Combine the bread crumbs, cheese, parsley and garlic. Blend well and
  season with salt and pepper. Distribute the filling among the 6
  artichokes, placing some in the center and tucking some between the
  spread leaves. Close the leaves gently and arrange the artichokes
  close together in a baking pan. Pour 1 Tbsp of oil over each. Add 1
  cup of water to the bottom of the pan. Cover tightly with aluminum
  foil and bake in a 325 F oven, basting occasionally, for about 1 hour
  45 minutes, or until the leaves pull out easily. Add waterif
  necessary to maintain a little liquid in the pan.
  
  Serves 6.

      2 c  Fresh rasberries or
           -strawberries
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Mace
           Fresh rose petals,if desired
           -(not commercial roses; they
           -are sprayed with pesticides
 
  **Sprinkle prepared pears with lemon juice to prevent discoloration.**
  
  Combine water, wine, sugar, cardamom (pop seed sout of the pods), and
  cloves in a sauce pan.  Bring to a boil, then add pear ahlves and
  simmer about 10 minutes.  Turn once or twice, then remove form heat

  To Make Sauce: Combine berries, cinnnamon and mace; mash these very
  well (or use food proccessor). Press through sieve to strain out
  seeds. Spoon out some onto a dessert plate, enough to cover most, but
  not all, of the bottom.  Drain the pears from their cooking liquid
  (which you may reserve, strain and add to fruit juice and put over
  ice for a cool drink) and place them cut side down in the puddle of
  the berry sauce. Sprinkle with rose petals for effect.
  
  (Kim's Note: I've served it with a fresh mint leaf garnish, tiny bits
  of black-caps as garnish, and many other garnishes as well...but the
  rose petals, if you can get them [remember, no pesticides!], is
  georgeous!)

           -yolk
           Bread Dough
           -1 tsp. cream or canned milk

  Remove cardamom seeds from pods and crush in mortar or place in small
  plastic bag and use rolling pin. Flatten the ball of dough. Sprinkle
  crushed seeds over surface and knead until evenly distributed through
  the dough.  Divide in twelve pieces and shape as desired for muffin
  tins. They can be made into a plain ball and then, after the top is
  generously buttered, cut deeply with a Kaiser cutter or slashed with
  a deep cross in the top with sharp knife or scissors. They are also
  nice made up in brioche shape.  Cut off about 1/4 of the dough and
  make a tiny ball to place firmly on top of the larger ball before
  brushing all over with butter. When light, bake for about 25 minutes
  in oven preheated to 350. About 5 minutes before the end of the
  baking period brush the tops of the rolls with the egg yolk and cream
  beaten together. Bake to a golden, glossy brown. These rolls are
  perfect for serving with a chilled fresh fruit salad and whipped
  cheese spread.

 Categories: Breads, Digest
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Ground cardamon
    3/4 c  Soymilk
    1/2    Cup
 
  2     Tbsp  pear puree (directions follow) 2 tsp lemon juice 1 tsp
  almond extract 1 tsp vanilla 1 tsp artificial sugar substitute (or 2
  Tbsp sucanat) 2
     Tbsp  cornstarch
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Coat 10 muffin wells with non-stick
  spray. Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In
  a medium bowl, stir together remaining ingredients. The cornstarch
  will tend to stick together as a lump; make certain it is completely
  dissolved in the liquid.  Pour dry ingredients in to wet and stir
  just long enough to mix completely.  Spoon batter into the prepared
  muffin wells (the wells will be about half-full). Bake muffins for
  25-30 minutes, until tops are lightly golden.  Allow the muffins to
  rest a few minutes before removing to a cooling rack.  Serve, or cool
  completely and store in an air-tight container up to two days.
  
  Pear puree:  Puree is easily made by blending, until smooth, half of
  the fruit in a 15 oz. container of canned pears (packed in fruit
  juice is preferrable) . "Baby food" pureed pears are an even faster
  alternative.
  
  Note: If pears packed in juice are used, 1/4 cup of the juice can be
  substituted for 1/4 of the soymilk and the sweetener omitted.

  :          *****  NONE  *****
  
  Find a corrugated cardboard box about 2 in larger around than a cookie
  sheet.  Make sure it has an intact bottom and top "ears". Cut the
  bottom out all the way around and secure together with duct tape.
  Line the box inside and out with heavy duty aluminum foil and secure
  seams with duct tape.  Cut foil at the corners to free "ears". This
  is for venting. Line the lid with foil and secure seams with duct
  tape. Get four wire coat hangers and snip the hook off below the
  twist and straighten. Punch holes in the box about 6 in from the top,
  then push hanger wires thorough to make a rack. To Use: Start a
  charcoal fire with 6-8 briquettes in an old metal pie pan.  Place a
  piece of foil on the ground shiny side up. Put the pie pan on the
  foil and place the oven over the pie pan. Put your food to be baked
  on the rack and cover with the lid. If you have a meat thermometer,
  stick it into the box just below the rack. 6-8 briquettes should
  bring temp to 325-350. Add or take out to adjust temp. This should be
  done before starting to bake.

  little hot water or rum if it is too thick, or continue to simmer if
  it is too thin. Serve at once with a dollop of yogurt or sour cream.

      3    Garlic cloves, chopped fine
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Fresh grated ginger root
      1 ts Fresh thyme or 1/2 t dried

    3/4 c  Orange juice
           Salt and black pepper to
           Taste
 
  Saut the onions and garlic until barely soft.  Add the spices and saut
  until very soft.  Stir in the beans and orange juice and saute for
  about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Mash a
  few of the beans with a fork or that back of a spoon. Add salt and
  pepper to taste.
  
  From the _Moosewood Cooks At Home_ book, again.  They are a little
  dry on their own.  The book recommends serving them with Mango Salsa.
  This is good but more work. They could probably be served with
  regular, store-bought salsa and/or sour cream and/or guacamole.

 Categories: Meats, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Pork steaks
      1    Small cabbage head
      4    Carrots
      1 c  Chicken stock or broth
    1/4 ts Garlic salt
      1 tb Ground Allspice
           Salt & pepper; to taste
      1 tb Butter, margerine or oil
      2 tb Water; for deglazing
 
  Brown pork steaks in butter, margerine or oil. Set aside to cool.
  Deglaze skillet with 2 T water. Pour liquor into a 4 qt pot. Cut
  carots into 1/8" thick slices. Add to pot and set pot over medium
  heat. Add chicken stock, garlic salt, allspice, salt and pepper to
  pot. Remove any bones from the pork steaks and cut them crosswise
  into 1/4" wide strips. Add the pork strips to the pot. Core and
  coarsly chop the cabbage. Add to pot. Stir well to mix all the
  ingredients. Cover the pot and allow the meat and vegetables to steam
  for a few minutes, but not too long. The carrots and cabbage should
  still be somewhat crisp (al dente) when served. Serve with steamed
  rice. OPTIONS: Alter spices any way you like. Add, delete or
  substitute any of the ingredients. This dish is versatile, fast, easy
  and very inexpensive. Since this is my first attempt at uploading
  from MM to the Food Forum, I thought this was an appropriate recipe.
  It's the first thing I ever cooked that had more than one ingredient.
  It dates back to my college days (early 60's) when I, nor my
  roommates, had much money. We had to build meals for four hungry guys
  on a budget that allowed less than five bucks per meal. One of the
  group hailed from Jamaica W.I. He devised this recipe based (loosly)
  on something his grandmother prepared. It cost less than two bucks to
  feed us all. Needless to say we started eating a variation of this
  recipe almost every night. On Friday night we spent the money we had
  saved to buy the five basic food groups (chili dogs, fries, pizza,
  burgers and beer). Today, thirty years later, this recipe will still
  feed four people for less than five dollers and takes less than 20
  minutes to make.

  I love Puerto Rican Food!... It's usually simple, yet rich with lots
  of cilantro and garlic!!.  Enclosed are examples of 4 dishes that can
  be simplified to taste. I always add mucho mas cilantro, peppers and
  garlic with fresh ingredients (I never used canned foods).
  
  I prefer to also add a pinch of red chili powder just to make it
  interesting (not a traditional ingredient in Puerto Rican food).
  
  Wash chicken pieces, dry and rub with Seasoning Mix. Set in
  refrigerator for several hours or overnight.
  
  In heavy kettle, brown pork and ham in oil.  Reduce to moderate heat,
  add chicken pieces, and cook for 5 minutes.
  
  Reduce heat to low, add onion, peppers, tomato, and cilantro, and
  saute for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  Meanwhile, drain liquid from can of peas into a measuring cup and add
  enough water or chicken broth to measure 2 1/2 cups if regular rice is
  used, or 3 1/2 cups if long grain rise is used. Reserve peas.
  
  Add to kettle salt, olives, capers, tomato sauce, saffron, and rice,
  and mix over moderate heat for 2 minutes.
  
  Add reserved liquid to kettle, mix well, and cook, uncovered over
  moderate heat until rice is dry.
  
  With a fork, turn rice from bottom to top.
  
  Cover kettle and cook over low heat for 40 minutes. Halfway during
  this cooking period, turn rice over again.
  
  Add peas, mix rice once more, cover, and cook for 15 minutes over low
  heat.
  
  Garnish rice with pimientos.

 Categories: Info/tips, Wok
      Yield: 1 Info
 
           No ingredients
 
  A properly seasoned wok should not be scoured with abrasive material
  such as steel wool. After cooking foods in the wok, iti s best to run
  very hot water into it and clean the surface of the wok with a bamboo
  brush or plastic scour. Dry the wok thoroughly with a paper towel and
  store for future use. Some gourmets will place a small amount of oil
  on their fingertips to re-coat their woks to keep them in top cooking
  condition. Eventually through repeated usage, a dark brown film will
  develop in the wok. The wok is now truly seasoned. This film is
  essentially carbon and is not harmful to one's health. The bottom of
  the woks, the part that touches the cooking flame of the stove should
  definitely be scoured over occasionally to free it of collected
  residue.
  
  If one has the misfortune to accidentally burn food in the wok, it
  will be necessary to take steel wool and scour out the burnt material
  and then re-season the wok once again. Each time that one has to
  scour out the wok with abrasive material, then one should re-season
  the wok.
  
  Stainless steel woks sometimes stick when used to cook omelettes or
  for stir-frying meats. To overcome this problem, one can spend five
  minutes to "season" the wok before use or spray a coating of lecithin
  on the surface of the wok to allow for easy gliding of the foods.
  Lecithin is sold commercially under several brand names as
  "non-stick" cooking aids.

  slice the pepper down the middle oand spread it open so that it
  covers more territory. When sliced open like this, some peppers are
  big enough for 2 sandwiches. Some are much smaller and enough for
  only one sandwich. 8. Place one chicken breast half on each fo the
  sandwiches, on top of the chili pepper. 9. Place a slice of American
  cheese on the chicken. 10. Top it all off with the top bun. Makes 4

 Categories: Pasta, Poultry, Rice, Soups
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 c  Water
      4 c  Chicken Broth
      3 tb Minced Green Onion
    1/2 ts Coarse Ground Black Pepper
      1    Palmful Fresh Parsely
      1 lb Boneless Skinless Chicken
           Breast -- cut in tiny
           Pieces
      6 lg Carrots -- sliced
      1 cn Unsalted Green Beans,
           Undrained -- --or--
      1 lb Fresh Green Beans
      2 c  Rice -- --Or--
      1 lb Angel Hair Pasta
 
  Start this recipe a day in advance by boiling the chicken pieces in
  the 4 cups of water with the green onion, black pepper, and parsely.
  Put it the refrigerator overnight and the next day scoop the fat off
  the top.
  
  The next day, bring 4 cups of water to a boil and add the carrots.
  Boil for 10 minutes or so.  Dump in the stock and chicken from the
  day before and the green beans and bring back to a boil. The next
  part of the cooking takes 20 minutes:
  
  For rice -- Add the rice and cook according to rice directions, about
  20 minutes for white rice (I've never used brown rice in this).
  
  For dry angel hair -- dump it in at such a time as the 20 minutes is
  up at the same time the angel hair's done to your liking.
  
  For fresh angel hair from the refrigerated section at the grocery --
  put it in 3-4 minutes before the 20 minutes is up. Don't overcook the
  angel hair!!
  
  I try to get the pasta to be al dente, although sometimes the wine
  makes me forget!!  You may want to experiment with spices because
  without salt, this recipe can be somewhat bland.
  
  One normal soup ladel full of this soup is somewhere around 300
  calories. I forget the actual calorie count of the individual
  ingredients, but I averaged them out from the counts given in a book
  I have. I do only one ladel. This stuff freezes well and makes great
  lunches.
  
  Oh, yes, the wine for this?  I like Bonny Doon '93 or '94 Clos du
  Gilroy. It has a peppery flavor that I think goes well with this
  light fare. My wife, a white wine fan, likes Chalk Hill Sauvignon
  Blanc (I forget the year model) because it too has a peppery flavor.

    1/4 ts Salt
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Kathi Crockett Now, I'd better get a
  recipe in here before the troups kick me out. Here's a fun and very
  easy party recipe for candied nuts: CARMELED PEANUTS Beat egg white
  and water until frothy - not stiff. Add peanuts, stir until they are
  well coated. Combine sugar and salt then pour this over the nuts &
  eggwhite mixture. Bake at 225 on a greased, tinfoil lined cookie
  sheet. Stir every 15 minutes for 1 hour.
  
  This makes a nice, big batch and is delicious. You can also use other
  nuts. I first started doing this because I was always at a loss as to
  what to do with the leftover nuts from Christmas and this certainly
  takes care of them in short order. It's one of those recipes where
  you can't eat just one.

      Title: CARNE ADOBADO ( CHILE-MARINADED PORK )
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Chile caribe
      4 c  Water
      2 ts Salt
      3    Cloves garlic
      2 tb Ground Mexican oregano
      2 tb Ground comino -- ( cumin )
      5 lb Pork loin chops -- thinly
           Sliced
 
  Combine the Chile Caribe and water in  a blender ans whirl intul
  mixed into a sauce. It will become somewhat thick, similar to ketchup
  in consistancy. Add salt, garlic, oregano and comino to the sauce and
  mix well. Trim the excess fat from the pork and lay slices flat in a
  large baking dish. Cover with the sauce; turn the meat once to coat
  evenly on both sides. Allow to marinate in the refrigerator
  overnight. You can either cook this in the oven covered with aluminum
  foil at 325 degrees for 30 minutes then uncover and bake another 30
  minutes or grill over a fire with mesquite CHUNKS ( chips just burn
  up, chunks give a much better flavor ) that have been soaked for
  several hours in water. I prefer the grilling method. I also add a
  touch of oil to the marinade and baste my pork loin with it when
  grilling.  This makes great fajitas or just serve the meat as an
  entree with rice and good beans.

  butter on tortilla; top with meat and any combination of vegetables
  or sauce. Roll up to eat.
  
  Note:  Be sure to heat basting sauce thoroughly to ensure safety for
  use as a sauce at the table.

 Categories: Pork, Ceideburg
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 kg Boneless pork, cubed
      2 lg Onions, chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      3 lg Tomatoes, diced
    100 ml Boiling water
           Salt and pepper to taste
  1 1/2 c  Brown lentils
      4 c  Water
      4 lg Firm bananas
      3 tb Chopped fresh coriander
 
  Many years ago, restaurant dining meant fruit with every- thing. Now
  fruit is desperately passe. But it's a mistake to throw out the
  authentic with the spurious. This surprising but satisfying
  combination of ingredients originates in South America.
  
  In a large saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and brown on all
  sides 1 kg cubed boneless pork. Add 2 large onions, chopped, and 2
  cloves of garlic, minced, and brown them. Add 3 large tomatoes,
  diced, 100 mL boiling water and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and
  cook very slowly for about 1 1/2 hour. Meanwhile simmer 1 1/2 cups
  brown lentils in 4 cups water for 45 minutes; do not drain.
  
  Add the undrained lentils to the pork mixture, combine well, cover
  and cook over a low heat for a further 30 minutes, until both the
  pork and the lentils are tender.
  
  Taste for seasoning. Add 4 large firm bananas cut into 2 cm pieces
  and 3 tablespoons or more of chopped, fresh coriander. Cook 10
  minutes longer. Serve with a little more coriander scat- tered on
  top. (You can use the coriander stems as well as the leaves, provided
  they are well washed. Finely chopped they add interesting crunch.)

      Title: CARNE DE PUERCO CON CHILE VERDE
 Categories: Pork, Mexican, New_mexican
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 lb Boneless pork roast
     48 oz Tomatillos, drained &
           -crushed
     16 oz Green chiles; chopped
           -(Ortega mild green)
      5    Garlic cloves; crushed
      1 lg Onion, chopped
    3/4 c  ;Water
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  optional -- your favorite fresh green chiles, chopped or sliced.
  Cilantro if you like it.
  
  Slice up the pork and trim away most of the fat.  Dice both the lean
  meat and the fat into 1/2-inch cubes; set the diced fat aside.
  
  In a heavy pot over a hot flame, cook the lean pork with the water,
  stirring until the water is gone and the meat begins to brown. Add
  onion & garlic, and stir constantly until the onion becomes
  transparent.
  
  Reduce heat to a simmer and add tomatillos & canned chilis (be *sure*
  to drain the tomatillos before crushing; the water they are packed in
  is too salty).
  
  Cover the pot and simmer slowly for about an hour, stirring
  occasionally to prevent sticking.
  
  Meanwhile, render the diced pork fat into cracklings by sauteeing in a
  skillet over medium heat until the pieces are brown and crispy. Drain
  and salt the cracklings and set aside; save the lard for any other
  dish where you want some high-quality cholesterol stuff.
  
  After an hour the chile verde should be pretty juicy but not watery.
  Add a little water if it's too dry. Add salt & pepper to taste, and
  if you want it hotter, add your fresh chiles now. Cover and simmer
  again for at least half an hour.  The longer the better.
  
  To serve, sprinkle with chopped cilantro (if used) and the cracklings.
  Serve with Spanish rice, tortillas, black beans, and ice-cold beer.
  Serves 6 or 8.

      2 tb Vegetable oil
      4    Lamb shanks
      2 md White onions, halved

      4 c  Garlic, minced
    3/8 ts Oregano
    1/2 ts Cumin
     28 oz Tomato, whole peeled
    3/4 c  Beef stock
      4    Bay leaf
      1 tb Cider vinegar
           Romaine lettuce, shredded
           Black olives, pitted
 
  1. Place chilies in small bowl with boiling water, let stand 1 hour
  2. Heat lard or oil in Dutch oven over med. heat until hot. Add 2
  lamb shanks. Cook turning often, until brown on all sides about 20
  minutes. Remove to plate. Repeat. 3. Place chilies and 1/3 cup of the
  soaking liquid in a blender and process until smooth. Discard
  remaining soaking liquid. 4. Remove and discard all but 2 TBS oil
  from Dutch oven. Add onions and saute' over medium heat about 4 mins.
  or until soft. Reduce heat to med-low and stir in raisins, sugar,
  garlic, oregano and cumin. Add chili puree and cook stirring
  constantly for 2 minutes. 5. Add tomatoes, stock and bay leaves to
  pan. Heat to boiling. Add lamb shanks and simmer over low heat,
  covered, turning occasionally until lamb is very, very tender--about
  2 to 2/12 hours/ 6. Remove lamb to serving platter and keep warm.
  Skim and discard fat from cooking sauce. Stir in vinegar. Heat sauce
  to boiling over med.-high heat and cook uncovered, stirring
  frequently until sauce is thickened--about 10 minutes. Spoon sauce
  over lamb. Serve, garnished with lettuce and olives (Maybe even some
  quartered tomatoes). Accompany with Refried Beans garnished as
  desired with shredded cheese and diced white onions. I recommend with
  shanks that you clean them as well as possible of as much fat as
  possible plus that white membrane. Don't remove all the membrane,
  however, as something has to hold them together.

 Categories: Breads, Desserts, Ethnic
      Yield: 18 Servings

      8 tb Unsalted Butter
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  All-Purpose Flour, Sifted
      4    Eggs
      1 ts Freshly Grated Orange Rind
      1 ts Freshly Grated Lemon Rind
      4 c  Peanut Oil
           Confectioners Sugar
 
  Combine the water, butter, sugar, and salt in a small sauce pan and
  bring to a boil. When butter is melted, add flour. Stir vigorously
  with a whisk until the mixture leaves the sides of the pan, a matter
  of seconds. Remove from heat and cool slightly.
  
  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating vigorously with a spoon after
  each addition. Add the grated orange and lemon rinds. Mix thoroughly
  until smooth.
  
  In a deep skillet, heat the peanut oil to 300° F (the temperature is
  important because if the oil is too hot, the fritters will cook too
  fast on the outside and not puff up.)
  
  Drop the batter by the tablespoonful into the hot oil, no more than 4
  or 5 at a time. When the fritters are browned and puffed, remove them
  with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with
  confectioners sugar.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     12 md Cucumbers; sliced *
      5    Onions; sliced thin
    1/4 c  Pickling salt
           Brine:
      3 c  Sugar
  4 1/2 ts Celery seed
      3 c  Cider vinegar
  4 1/2 ts Mustard seed
      2 ts Curry powder
      2 c  Water
 
  Recipe by: CAROL KOSOWSKI (YPZW00A) * (not too old as the older ones
  have too many seeds in them). In a large roasting pan,layer the
  cukes, then the onions,back to the cukes and the onions again
  sprinkling with the pickling salt in between the layers. let soak for
  3 hours and then drain the juice and discard. Next you make a brime
  for the pickles and onions. 3 cups of sugar, 4 1/2 teaspoons mustard
  seed, 4 1/2 tsp.celery seed, 2 tsp.curry powder, 3 cups cider vinegar,
        2    cups water. Heat this to boiling and then add the drained
  cukes and onions and simmer on low for10 min only.(hummm, it starts
  to smell up the kitchen and you just want to eat them right away).
  Now having hot sterilized large canning jars, fill to cover all the
  pickles and onions to the top. Put a bread knife into each jar to
  bring up the air in the liquid and of course don't leave it there,
  take the knife out and put on the caps and seal.  You may hear the
  seal take place with a pop and you can see that the cover seems to
  suck in and it should hold that way for a tight seal.I turn the jars
  over and let stand til cool. To check a tight seal you can push down
  on the top of the cover and if it does not snap up after you let go,
  then you have a tight seal.  If the cover does pop right up after
  pushing down and releasing then you have a poor seal, You could just
  eat those pickles now. yumm yumm.don'tput it away to store. You can
  also draw some water in a large bowl or pan or even in the sink and
  take each cooled jar and imerge the top into the water and check for
  bubbles coming from the top. If you see bubbles coming from the lid
  then you have a bad seal. Doesn't happen very often. Store the jars
  in a dark cool place.as far as how long you can keep them, you could
  keep them up to one year because of the vinegar will protect the
  pickles but I doubt it very much after you open one jar, it would
  last one year. Here is a pickle recipe I would love to share with you
  all.It is an old one I have had for over 30 years. CAROL KOSOWSKI

      2 tb Oil
      1    Celery rib; diced
  1 1/2 ts Chili powder
      1 ts Cumin
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
      1 c  Tomato; chopped

      4 c  Beans, kidney, black, pinto
           -and/or garbanzo; cooked
    1/2 lb Tofu; crumbled (opt)
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Oregano
 
  Saute onion and garlic in oil until onion is soft. Add celery and
  spices. Saute another 2-3 minutes. Add tomato and paste. Mash 2 cups
  of the beans and add beans and tofu to the pot along with the salt
  and oregano. Simmer 30 minutes.
  
  To cook raw beans:
  
  Soak beans in water overnight, OR boil for 2 minutes and let sit,
  covered, for 1 hour.  Bring to a boil in same water and simmer about
  1 hour or until tender. (beans approximately double in volume, i.e.,
  two cups raw = 4 cups cooked)
  
  Notes:  I like cooking my own beans rather than buying canned beans.
  :       I use as many different beans as I have at home. Usually at
  :       least 3 of the 4 mentioned, and one of the 3 must be black
  :       beans because they are my absolute favorite.
  :       Add or subtract cayenne pepper for hotness level.
  :       A bit more cumin may be good too, I have yet to determine
  this,
  :       though.

      2    Bay leaves
 
  Here is what I do.  I brown the meat in the olive oil. I add the
  onions & saute till they are somewhat tender. I then add all the
  other ingredients. Usually the canned ones first then the fresh
  ingred. Let this come to a boil & then turn down.  Simmer with the
  stockpot cover OFF for 6 or more hours.  Of course, you can use
  sooner. I like it to cook down & thicken. Either way it is very good.
  Many times I add more mushrooms as I like them. Do slice them
  thickly; i.e. 3 slices to one very large mushroom. I like to see the
  mushrooms! SMILE. This isn't a traditional recipe for spaghetti
  sauce.  It is something that has "happened" over the years. It
  finally developed into what you see. My husband, Punky aka Hap,
  enjoys this recipe very much.  I certainly hope you do too. I don't
  think I have forgotten anything. Oh, we use the low salt stuff - you
  don't have to do that. My guy had bypass surgery in Aug. so we are
  watching the sodium. I now make this with ground turkey too.  It is
  very good with the turkey. Several Prodigy members have tried this
  recipe. To my delight--they have liked it very much.  I hope you do
  too.  Oh, yes, this does freeze well. I just made 16 quarts of this
  on Sunday. I usually add some more garlic when I unfreeze a portion.
  This seems to make it tastier. We love garlic in our sketti! I also
  add some red crushed pepper flakes to my plate of sketti. Punky does
  not like things as hot as I. Remember to adjust seasonings to your
  taste. Enjoy. Carol Rheaume-Frischknecht l/l5 ll:03 PM PST

  onion. Cook for 3 to 4 more minutes.
  
  Add the zucchini, summer  squash, tomatoes, basil, oregano and the
  bouillon cube.  Add the chili powder and the hot sauce. Bring to a
  boil, stirring all ingredients together.  Reduce the heat and simmer
  for 15 minutes, or until the zucchini is tender but yet crisp.  Be
  sure to stir occasionally so things don't burn on the bottom of the
  pot.
  
  When finished toss with pasta and then sprinkle on liberal amounts of
  parsley.
  
  Total preparation time should be less than 30 minutes.

      1    Strip lemon peel
    1/2 oz Prepared dried carrageen *
      1 tb Sugar
      1    Egg
      2    Sticks rhubarb **
      4 tb Rosehip or redcurrant jelly
 
  *Note: Carrageen is a purple-brown or green fronded seaweed common on
  Scottish beaches on the mid-tide line. It can be used to set and
  delicately flavour a jelly or thicken a soup. If you gather your own
  fresh, you will need about 2 oz to set a pint of milk. Dried
  carrageen is available in health-food stores, or Chinese supermarkets
  in processed form, as agar-agar. **Rhubarb sticks should be sliced
  and lightly poached with additional sugar. Bring the milk to the boil
  with the lemon rind. Stir in the carrageen and cook for a couple of
  minutes until the milk thickens enough to coat the back of a wooden
  spoon. Add sugar. Allow the mixture to cool until it is at blood

      Title: CARRAGEEN PUDDING WITH RHUBARB & ROSEHIP JELL
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 pt Milk
      1    Strip lemon peel
    1/2 oz Prepared dried carrageen *
      1 tb Sugar
      1    Egg
      2    Sticks rhubarb **
      4 tb Rosehip or redcurrant jelly
 
  *Note: Carrageen is a purple-brown or green fronded seaweed common on
  Scottish beaches on the mid-tide line. It can be used to set and
  delicately flavour a jelly or thicken a soup. If you gather your own
  fresh, you will need about 2 oz to set a pint of milk. Dried
  carrageen is available in health-food stores, or Chinese supermarkets
  in processed form, as agar-agar. **Rhubarb sticks should be sliced
  and lightly poached with additional sugar.
  
  Bring the milk to the boil with the lemon rind.  Stir in the
  carrageen and cook for a couple of minutes until the milk thickens
  enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Add sugar.
  
  Allow the mixture to cool until it is at blood temperature (100 F, 40
  C). Whisk the egg till frothy and then whisk in the warm milk until
  smooth. Pour the mixture through a sieve into a cold-wetted
  ring-mould. Then put it in the fridge to set - it will only take
  about 1/2 hour.
  
  Run hot water over the outside of the mould and turn out the jelly.
  Fill the middle of the ring with a ladleful of rhubarb compote and
  surround with a little scarlet sauce of rosehip or redcurrant jelly
  melted in a little hot water.

 Categories: Alcohol, Beverages
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lg Box Orange Jell-O; or two
           -small boxes
      2 c  Boiling Water
  1 1/2 c  Cold Water
    1/2 c  Rum; * see note
           -----Variation-----
      1 sm Box Orange Jell-O; or Cherry
           -Jell-O
      1 c  Boiling Water
      1 c  Cold Water; (package
           -directions)
 
  * (I used "Cockspur" dark rum from Barbados, West Indies.)
  
  Little "souffle cups" or Dixie Cups, Bathroom-size
  
  Make up the Orange Jell-O, with the rum, in the usual way. (Dissolve
  the Jell-O thoroughly in the boiling water, etc.)
  
  Distribute into individual servings.
  
  Make up the Orange Jell-O without the rum, in the usual way.
  
  Distribute into individual servings.
  
  Let all of the Orange Jell-O set for about 1-2 hours. (It helps if
  you mark them specially, or put them in different cups, or on
  different trays or different refrigerators or something. I put an X
  on the non-alc. cups.)
  
  Mix up the Cherry Jell-O. Let it cool, about half an hour or so.
  
  Make sure the Orange Jell-O (both with and without rum) have set
  enough not to slosh when you wiggle them. Pull a tray out of the
  fridge (I assume you set the cups on trays!) and carefully pour a
  little bit of Cherry Jell-O on top of each serving. Just enough to
  cover them. Then put them back in the fridge, and do the next batch.
  (Do the rum ones first, then the nonalcoholic.)
  
  If you do it just right, there should be enough cherry Jell-O to make
  a little red layer on top of each orange Jell-O cup. If you
  miscalculate, well, you'll probably have a bunch of regular ordinary
  orange Jell-O, and the kids will still be happy with them. (Plus
  they'll be easier to tell apart.)
  
  Put it all back in the fridge, let 'em set, serve the next day.
  Voila, you have regular and unleaded (atomic and steam-powered?)
  versions, and (apart from the rum flavor) they'll be similar.
  Everyone will be happy. That's the theory, anyway...
  
  Good luck! I'm taking them to a club meeting tonight, we'll see if it
  goes over well..

      Title: CARROT & POTATO PANCAKES
 Categories: Pancakes
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 lg Carrot
      1 lg Potato
    1/2    Onion
      2 tb Chopped parsley
      1    Egg
  1 1/2 tb Milk
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1 tb Flour
           Olive oil
           Creme fraiche
 
  These little pancakes, like a lot of now fashionable food, are
  equally at home as nursery fare or as an entree or side-dish at a
  smart dinner party. Nice served with a dollop of creme fraiche.
  
  Grate (a food processor speeds things up) 1 large carrot, 1 large
  potato and half an onion and transfer to a bowl. Add 2 tablespoons
  chopped parsley, 1 egg, beaten, 1 1/2 tablespoons milk, salt and
  pepper to taste and 1 tablespoon plain flour. (Add a little more
  flour if the mixture looks too thin.) Heat a little olive oil in a
  heavy frying pan and drop in the mixture by the dessertspoon if you
  want elegant little pancakes, by the heaping tablespoon for a more
  pedestrian size. Cook until brown and crisp on the underside then
  turn and cook the other side. Serve.

     50 g  Apricot jelly
           Fondant icing
           Marzipan carrots
 
  (Units: 100 g = 3 1/2 oz; 1 dl = 3 1/2 fl oz = 2/5 cup; 180 oC = 350

  inch)
  
  The Story:
  
  The cultivation of vegetables in Aargau is one of the main reasons
  for the existence of a thriving canning/bottling industry. In this
  area, the carrot is the Queen of all vegetables and it has attributes
  which allow it to be used everywhere, even in desserts.
  
  This carrot cake is now a Swiss classic, its reputation having been
  extended long ago far beyond the borders of the canton. Some maintain
  that the cake is better two days after baking as the carrots keep it
  moist.
  
  The Recipe:
  
  Beat together the egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest, until
  light.
  
  Add the finely grated carrots and the almonds.
  
  Mix in the cornflour, cinnamon, ground cloves and baking powder. Then
  add the kirsch.
  
  Mix or beat until smooth.
  
  Beat the egg whites until stiff and carefully fold in.
  
  Butter a tin (24 cm diameter, 5 cm high), dust with flour. Turn the
  mixture into the tin.
  
  Bake in the oven for 50 ... 60 minutes at 180 oC.
  
  When cooked, brush the cake with a hot apricot glaze and thin fondant
  icing. Decorate with small marzipan carrots.

      Title: CARROT CAKE WITH AN INDIAN FLAVOR
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts, Indian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 ts Vegetable oil
      1 c  Unbleached white flour
           -- plus extra for dusting
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 lg Eggs
    1/4 ts Ground cardamom seeds
      1 c  Granulated sugar
    1/4 c  Softened clarified butter
           -- (ghee)
  1 1/2 c  Grated carrots
           -- firmly packed
      2 tb Chopped pistachios
      2 tb Chopped blanched almonds
      2 tb Raisins
           Edible silver foil (opt.)
 
  "A characteristic sweet of southern India is carrot halvah, a rich,
  sweet reduction of carrots and spices that is almost fudgelike in
  consistency. This cake falls somewhere between this traditional treat
  and the popular American carrot cake.  It has a dense texture and the
  unexpected flavor of cardamom, yet doesn't require the tedious
  cooking and stirring of a halvah.
  
  "Special Indian dishes are often decorated with silver foil -- a
  microscopic thin sheet of edible, flavorless real silver, available in
  Indian groceries.  We have cut edible foil into decorative shapes -- a
  tedious business that must be done in a completely draftless room --
  but more manageable solid toppings are customary.
  
  "Serve this nontraditional ending to your Indian meal with coffee
  that has been brewed with a few cardamom seeds."
  
  Rub a round cake pan that is 9 inches in diameter and 1-1/2 inches in
  height with the vegetable oil and then dust it very lightly with
  flour. Preheat the oven to
      350    F.
  
  Sift 1 cup flour with the baking soda and salt.
  
  Beat the eggs well in a large bowl.  Add the cardamom, sugar, and
  clarified butter.  Keep beating until all the ingredients are
  thoroughly mixed.
  
  Add the sifted flour mixture to the ingredients in the large bowl and
  fold it in gently with a spatula.  Add the carrots, pistachios,
  almonds, and raisins.  Fold them in gently as well.
  
  Turn the cake batter into the oiled and floured cake pan and bake for
  35 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes
  out clean and the top is golden red.  Decorate top with edible silver
  foil.

      Title: CARROT PATE
 Categories: Appetizers, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Carrots; sliced
    1/4 c  Onion; diced
      1 ea Garlic clove; slivered
    1/4 ts Dill
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  -Water
      1 tb Arrowroot; dissolved in
      1 tb -Water
      2 tb White miso
    1/4 ts Sea salt
      2 tb Tahini; optional
 
  "For this recipe you may use a food processor instead of a blender to
  puree the carrots. Mash the carrots roughly before pureeing them. You
  might need to add a little extra water; in which case, simmer the
  pureed, flavored carrots for a little while longer. The pare should
  not feel wet. The additional of two tablespoons of tahini will make
  the pate taste richer and help hold the ingredients together."
  
  In a medium saucepan, saute the carrots, onions, garlic and dill in
  the oil for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the water, cover, and simmer until
  the carrots are tender (about 20 minutes). Puree until a smooth paste
  and return to the saucepan. Combine the dissolved arrowroot, miso,
  salt and tahini, if you wish. Add this mixture to the pureed carrots.
  Bring to a slow simmer, stirring constantly and cook until the pate
  detaches itself from the sides of the pan. Remove from heat, turn the
  pate mixture out onto a lightly oiled serving dish and let cool.
  Serve the pate with crackers or toast, or serve it as a dip with
  crisp, raw vegetables.

  eggsclusive secrets carefully separate cold eggs stirring a small
  amount of hot mixture into beaten egg yolks warms them. This step --
  called tempering -- prevents the egg yolks from lumping (coagulating)
  _______________________ puffing secrets even the smallest amount of
  fat, including that in a ddrop of yolk, keeps the egg white from
  beating properly. Because wooden and plastic bowls tend to absorb fat
  avoid using them when beating egg whites stiff but not dry mean egg
  whites no longer slip when the bowl is titled. To fold in a beated
  egg white, use a down-across-up-and-over motion with a rubber spatual
  to cut through the carrot mixture. Fold just until there aren't any
  remaining streaks.  don't stir -- it forces out the air in the beaten
  white. ___________________ dish size is important; if the container
  is too small, the mixture may run over, if the container is too large
  the mixture won't rise to the rim and have it tradition appearance.
  Use a straight-sided casserole if you don't have a traditional
  souffle dish. _______________________ BAKING SECRETS Place souffle
  into a preheated oven immediately after mixing. Don't peek, opening
  the oven door will cause a souffle to collapse. the top will be

      Title: CARROT-RAISIN BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/4 ts Fermipan or Red Star dry
           -yeast
      3 c  Bread flour
    1/3 c  Oat bran (optional)
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Sugar
      2 tb Nonfat dry milk powder (or
           -more for extra protein)
      2 tb Canola oil
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
      1 c  Carrot pulp from the juicer
           -(at room temp.)
      1 c  Tepid water
    3/4 c  Raisins, added at the "beep"
 
  Process on white bread setting. I prefer to start the machine with
  only part of the water added, then add the rest in a slow drizzle
  while it is running. That helps assure that I don't add too much
  water if the weather is humid or the pulp moister than usual.

      2 ts Virgin olive oil

  SCRAPE THE CARROTS and slice them into pieces 2- to 3-inches long.
  Cut each piece lengthwise into quarters or, if the carrots are very
  large, into sixths or eighths. All the pieces should be about the
  same size. Tear or chop the herbs. Warm the oil with the cumin seeds
  and green herbs for a few moments to bring out their fragrances; then
  add the carrots and toss them in the oil. Add a few pinches of salt,
  the water, and the vinegar; bring to a boil. Lower the heat, and
  simmer until tender, about 40 minutes. By this time, the liquid
  should have reduced to almost nothing, leaving the carrots nicely
  glazed. If the pan becomes dry before the carrots are done, add more
  water in 1/4- or 1/2-cup increments until they are sufficiently
  tender. When done, season with pepper and serve with a garnish of
  fresh herbs.

  oil. Peel 1/2 inch or so of ginger and chop it as finely as possible;
  then crush the small garlic clove.  Add both these ingredients to the
  bowl with a little salt and pepper. Mix well then push 2 sprigs of
  mint into the liquid. Scrub and scrape the carrots, or peel them if
  you insist, then grate them coarsely and add to the dressing. Peel

      3    Star Anise
  1 1/2 lb Carrots, Pref Organic
        pn Sugar
      1 oz Butter
        pn Salt
 
  I make this with organic carrots, their natural sweetness is
  unequalled by the other kind! Peel and trim the carrots and cut them
  across into slices about quarter of an inch thick. Put them in a
  solid pan, wide enough to hold them in two or three layers. Add the
  aniseed, which you can leave in the star shaped shell, the sugar,
  salt and butter and enough water just to cover everything. Cook them
  over a fierce heat, turning a couple of times, until the water boils
  away and the carrots just start to sizzle. At that moment the carrots
  will be done. It takes about 12 minutes, depending on the thickness
  and size of the pan. The carrots absorb the exotic flavour of the
  star anise and the butter and sugar coats them with a glaze.

      Title: CARROT~ CELERY~ & APPLE JUICE WITH SORREL
 Categories: Vegetables, Fruits
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      3 lb Of fresh whole carrots
      1    Or 2 stalk of celery
      1    Granny Smith apple
      3    To 6 sorrel leaves to taste
 
  This juice requires the use of a juice machine such as the Champion,
  the Juice Man, Olympic, or the like. The sorrel adds a nice lemony
  tartness to the drink that helps the celery balance the sweetness of
  the carrots. For the apple, use no other than the Granny Smith, its
  sour flavor is an essential ingredient to this juice.
  ******************************************************* *************
  Clean the carrots and remove any green parts. Wash the celery but do
  not remove the leaves. Cut the granny smith apple into 1/8th segments
  and remove the bitter seed pod. Rinse the sorrel leaves. Run
  everything through the juicer starting with the carrots. After one or
  two carrots have been run through the machine put the celery and
  sorrel through and then alternate carrots and apples until they are
  gone. Strain the juice through a couple layers of cheesecloth or a
  fine strainer to remove the pulp that makes it through the juicer
  screen if desired (this will produce a clear juice devoid of the
  grittyness, that some people do like).

 Categories: Bakery, Italian, Breads
      Yield: 3 Sm. loaves
 
      1 ts Dried yeast
    1/4 c  Warm water
  3 1/2 c  Water at room temperature
  13/16 c  Biga Pugliese, see recipe
  3 3/4 c  Wholewheat flour
  3 3/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
      1 tb Salt
    1/3 lb Walnuts -=OR=-
    1/2 c  Shelled pistachios -=OR=-
    1/3 c  Pitted Italian black olive,
           -- all optional
 
  Stir the yeast into the warm water & let proof for 10 minutes. Add the
  remaining water & the biga, then the flours & the salt. Mix with a
  wooden spoon for 5 minutes. The dough will not pull away from the
  side of the bowl.  Wet your hands & knead on a lightly floured board
  to ensure that all the ingredients are well mixed. Turn into a
  lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap & let rise at room
  temperature until it has almost tripled in volume, 3 to 5 hours. This
  dough works very well if left to rise overnight or in the
  refrigerator. Let it come back to room temperature before shaping.
  Flour your work surface very well & flour a scaper. Turn the dough
  onto the work surface, but do not punch down. Divide into 3 equal
  pieces. Work in your filling if using by flattening the dough &
  sprinkling equal amounts of filing over the dough. Turn in the sides
  of the dough & roll each piece into a ball, being gentle but at the
  same time pulling the skin taut. Place the loaves on floured
  parchment paper set on baking sheets, cover with a heavy cloth & let
  rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 450F.  Bake the
  loaves for 15 minutes. At this point the dough should be set you can
  remove the paper. Slide the loaves directly onto the baking sheets &
  bake until crusty & golden, about 30 to 35 minutes.

      4 c  Fresh Grapefruit juice
      1 c  Fresh Orange juice
      3 ts Allspice (Jamaican)
      1 ts Salt
 
  : NOTE: Cascabel Peppers, this pepper is small (1 1/2 inch or so),
  round and dark brown. This is the "little rattles" pepper that comes
  from the Veracruz area. This pepper is not elongated, not black, not
  from South America, and not real hot. Cascabel is also known as the
  chili bola. : METHOD: Remove stem and seed from chiles. With a comal
  or black iron skillet, or in an oven at 250 degrees, dry roast chiles
  for 3 to 4 minutes. Shake once or twice and do not allow to blacken.
  Add to the water in a covered pan and simmer very low for 20 minutes
  to rehydrate. Allow to cool. SEE HINT. Taste the chile water, and if
  not bitter, add about 1/2 cup and the chiles to a blender (use plain
  water if bitter). Puree together with the garlic and strain. Add the
  fruit juices, allspice, and salt and mix together. : HINT: If a very
  smooth sauce is required, pass the rehydrated, coarsely chopped,
  chiles through a food mill, then proceed as above.

  but not too sticky.  Do the same with fresh coconut. Shape dough in
  balls of 1 inch diameter and fry in deep fat until golden brown.
  Drain dough balls on paper towel.  Then put them in a large mixing
  bowl.

  placing a drop of syrup in a bowl of cold water. If it retains it
  shape and is soft, it is ready.  Pour over dough balls.  Mix well so
  that all are coated with syrup. Remove from bowl and place them in a
  platter to cool. Excellent with coffee or tea.

      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 lb Chicken breast, skinned

MMMMM-------------------VEGETABLE INGREDIENTS------------------------
      4 x  Oil; Tbl - approx.
      2    Celery stalk; thinly sliced
    1/2 lb Green beans; 1/2" slices
      2    Carrot; 1/4" slices
      1    Onion; small, 1/4" slices
      2    Garlic clove, minced/pressed

  Cut skinned and boned chicken into matchstick-size pieces. Combine the
  ingredients for the "chicken mixture" ( cornstarch, soy, and
  chicken). Mix well to coat chicken thoroughly; set aside.
  
  Place wok in high heat. When wok is hot, add 2 TBL of the oil. When
  oil is hot, add chicken mixture. Stir fry until chicken is opaque
  (about 3 minutes). Remove chicken from the wok and set aside.
  
  Add remaining 2 TBL oil to the wok. When oil is hot, add celery,
  beans, carrot, and garlic. Stir fry 1 minute. Add water. Cover and
  cook for 3 minutes or until veggies are just tender-crisp.
  
  Return chicken and chicken broth mixture to pan. Stir until liquid
  boils and thickens (about 1 minute). Stir in most of the cashews.
  Garnish with the remaining cashews.
  
  This recipe is from Sunset "WOK Cook Book" and is a delightful stir

  1 1/2 ts Fresh lemon juice
      2 c  Roasted cashews
 
  In a heavy saucepan, preferably nonstick, bring the honey and lemon
  juice to a boil over medium-high heat.
   Add the nuts and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture
  thickens and darkens (be careful not to let it burn), about 15-20
  minutes. Pour out onto a nonstick pan, such as a jellyroll pan or a
  large skillet moistened with cold water and spread to a thickness of
  about 1/4 inch. Let cool completely. When fully hardened, break into
  small pieces. Makes about 3/4 pound of candy. Store in a tightly
  sealed tin.
  
  Since I adapted this from a recipe for nuant, or walnut brittle, I
  guess you can use any kind of nuts. You could dip the finished candy
  in melted chocolate, too.

      Title: CASHEW NUT BRITTLE
 Categories: Desserts, Candies, Holiday
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Dottie Cross TMPJ72B
      2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Light corn syrup
      1 c  (2 sticks) unsalted butter
    1/2 c  Water
      3 c  Unsalted raw cashew nuts;
           -coarsely chopped
      2 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Butter 2 baking sheets and set aside. Butter the sides of a 3-quart
  saucepan, and add the sugar, corn syrup, butter, and water. Stir over
  low heat until the butter has melted. Increase the heat and bring the
  mixture to a boil. Continue cooking over moderate heat, without
  stirring, for about 20 minutes, until the temperature reaches 275
  degrees F. (soft-crack stage) on a candy thermometer. Add the cashew
  nuts and continue cooking for about 5 minutes, until the candy
  thermometer registers 295 degrees F. (hard crack stage.) You may stir
  occasionally, if necessary. Remove from the heat and immediately sift
  the baking soda evenly over the surface. (Be careful---the syrup will
  foam up.) Add the vanilla and stir to distribute the soda and vanilla
  throughout the mixture. Pour at once onto the prepared baking sheets.
  Tilt the sheets to spread the brittle about 1/2-inch thick. Allow to
  cool until firm. Break the brittle into pieces and store in an
  airtight container. Variation: Peanuts or other nuts can be added
  instead of the cashews, or you can use a combination of several nuts.
  Always choose the raw unsalted nuts that are available in health-food
  and speciality stores. The nuts will cook and "toast" when added to
  the hot syrup. Makes abouy 2 pounds.

           Freshly ground black pepper
           Grated nutmeg
      1 tb Lemon juice

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE STUFFING---------------------------
      4 oz White breadcrumbs
      2 oz Butter (or margarine)
      1 sm Onion; grated
    1/2 ts Thyme
    1/2 ts Marjoram
      1 oz Parsley; chopped

MMMMM-------------------------TO GARNISH------------------------------
           Parsley sprigs
           Lemon slices
 
  Set the oven to 200C/400F/Gas Mark 6 and line a 450 g/1lb loaf tin
  with a long strip of nonstick paper; use some of the butter to grease
  the tin and paper well. Melt most of the remaining butter in a medium
  sized saucepan, add the onion and fry for about 10 minutes until
  tender but not browned. Remove from the heat.
  
  Grind the cashew nuts in a food processor with the bread and garlic,
  and add to the onion, together with the water or stock, salt, pepper,
  grated nutmeg and lemon juice to taste.
  
  Mix all the stuffing ingredients together.
  
  Put half the cashew nut mixture into the prepared tin, top with the
  stuffing, then spoon the rest of the nut mixture on top. Dot with the
  remaining butter.  Stand the tin in another tin to catch any butter
  which may ooze out, and bake for about 30 minutes, or until firm and
  lightly browned.  (Cover the roast with foil if it gets too brown
  before then.)
  
  Cool for a minute or two in the tin, then slip a knife around the
  sides, turn out the nut roast and strip off the paper. Decorate with
  sprigs of parsley and small slices of lemon, and surround with roast
  potatoes, if you're serving them.

      Title: CASSEROLE OF VENISON W/ PRUNES & PICKLED WALN
 Categories: Scot/irish, Meats, Casseroles
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 tb Flour; all-purpose (heaped)
    1/2 ts Salt
           Black pepper to taste
      3 lb Venison; cut into 1-inch
           .  cubes
      4 tb Sunflower oil
      3    Onions; finely sliced
  2 1/2 c  Red wine
  2 1/2 c  Water
      1 cn Pickled walnuts; 15oz, drain
      8    Prunes; soaked until soft,
           .  stoned & chopped
 
    The prunes and pickled walnuts provide just the sweet and sharp
  contrast that complements the flavour of venison so well.
  
    Put the flour, salt and a good grinding of pepper into a bowl. Toss
  the pieces of venison in the seasoned flour to coat. Heat the oil in
  a heavy flameproof casserole and brown the meat, a few pieces at a
  time; remove the browned meat and keep it warm while you brown the
  rest. When all the meat is browned, add the onions to the casserole
  and cook them until they are soft and translucent, 5-10 minutes. Stir
  in the wine and water, scraping the bits off the bottom of the
  casserole with a wooden spoon. When the liquid is simmering. replace
  the browned meat in the casserole, and stir in the pickled walnuts
  and prunes.
    Cover the casserole with a lid, and cook in a preheated moderate
  oven (350øF / 180øC / gas 4) for an hour. Let the casserole cool
  completely, then store in the refrigerator overnight. Cook it for a
  further hour at the same temperature before serving. All stews and
  casseroles benefit in flavour from reheating. "Lady MacDonald's

      Title: CASTILLIAN HOT CHOCOLATE
 Categories: Drinks, Spanish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Cocoa (powdered),
           -unsweetened
      1 c  Sugar
      7 ts Cornstarch (cornflour)
    1/2 c  Water
      4 c  Milk
 
  Mix the cocoa and sugar together.
  
  Dissolve the cornstarch (cornflour) in the water and combine with the
  cocoa-sugar mixture in a medium-sized saucepan. Stir this until it is
  a smooth paste. Begin heating this mixture, continuously stirring it
  with a whisk.  Gradually pour in the milk.  Continue stirring as you
  bring it to a simmer.  Simmer, stirring often, for about 10 minutes.
  The cocoa is ready when it thickens and is glossy and smooth.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Thick, rich Spanish hot chocolate -- I first tasted this wonderful
  beverage while touring in northern Spain with a choir. It's not like
  any hot chocolate I've had anywhere else, and I was delighted to find
  a recipe in "The Vegetarian Epicure Book Two." It is the best hot
  chocolate in the world (at least to me.)
  
  *  The consistency of the finished product should resemble chocolate
  pudding that didn't quite set. If you halve this recipe, you'll get
  just the right amount for two large mug-fulls. This cocoa is
  especially fantastic when you dip churros into it (a churro is a
  sugary, deep-fried, doughnut-like stick, and if anyone wants to send
  out a recipe, I'd be most grateful).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes.

      1 c  Bisquick
      1 c  Shredded Cheddar cheese
      1 lb Ground beef, turkey or pork
           Sausage

MMMMM-----------------------TO MAKE LITTER----------------------------
      2 c  Long grain rice
  3 3/4 c  Water
      2 ts Salt
      2 tb Butter or margarine

MMMMM---------------------------TOOLS--------------------------------
        lg Mixing bowl
           Rectangular baking pan
           Deep saucepan with lid
           Fork
           Paper towels
        lg Spoon
           Stainless steel pooper
           Scooper
 
  To make dumps: With an adult's help, preheat the oven to 350F. Using
  clean hans, mix together the dump ingredients in a large bowl. Mold
  pieces of this mixture into various size/shape dumps.
  
  Place so they don't touch each other in an ungreased baking pan. Use
  two if they don''t all fit. With an adult's help, bake the dumps for
  about 20 minutes or until they are all brown, firm and slightly
  crusty.
  
  While the meat cooks, put all four litter ingredients into a large
  saucepan. Then, with an adult's help, heat on high until the water
  comes to a boil. Stir, turn heat to low and cover the pan. Simmer
  without lifting the cover for fourteen minutes.
  
  With an adult's help, remove the saucepan from the stove and
  carefully (to avoid having your face melted away by the steam), lift
  off the cover. Break apart, or "fluff" the rice with a fork and set
  pan aside.
  
  When dumps are done, carefully transfer them onto paper towels to
  drain.
  
  Spoon the rice and dumps into the now empty baking pan, leaving some
  dumps partially uncovered, the way Kitty does when he/she is in a
  hurry. Serves 8-10 litterbox lovers. Use ppper scooper to serve.

  box on a bed of grapenuts, with a cat litter scoop. i hear you get
  lovely effects by decorating the box and scoop with melted chocolate

  new clumping litters, but i havent tried it. this recipe worked
  especially well at the halloween party where the table was already

      Title: CATALAN LAMB - GARLIC LAMB
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 tb Olive oil
      1    Shoulder of lamb
     20    Cloves garlic, peeled
           Flour
    300 ml Stock
      1 tb Tomato puree
 
  This recipe from northern Spain takes only minute of the cook's time
  but produces melting lamb in a lush sauce, thick with sweet (and
  innocuous) cloves of garlic.
  
  In a wide casserole which can be used on top of the stove, heat a
  tablespoon of olive oil and brown a shoulder of lamb on both sides.
  remove the meat and add to the saucepan 20 peeled whole cloves of
  garlic. Cook gently for a few minutes and sprinkle in a few
  tablespoons of flour, stir well, then continuing to stir, add 300 ml
  stock mixed with a tablespoon of tomato puree. Return the meat to the
  casserole, turn it over in the stock mixture, cover tightly and
  simmer very gently until the meat is cooked. Turn the meat over
  halfway through cooking and check at intervals, adding more stock if
  the sauce is getting dry.

  1 1/3 c  Honey
      2    Egg whites; stiffly beaten
    1/2 lb Almonds; blanched; peeled

  3 1/2 oz Hazelnuts; roasted; peeled

           Edible rice paper
 
  Put the honey in a heavy saucepan and place over medium heat. Stir it
  with a wooden spoon and when the honey begins to boil, remove the pan
  from the heat. Continue stirring until the honey thins to the
  consistency of pancake syrup.  Stir in the egg whites and return the
  mixture to the heat; continue cooking until it reaches a toffee-like
  consistency (hard-ball stage). Stir in the nuts and mix well.
  
  Spread the mixture in a jelly-roll pan lined with edible rice paper.
  Cover with a second sheet of rice paper and weight the top. Let it
  cool, then cut the nougat into 1-inch squares.
  
  When making nougat, the nuts should be warm.  Cover freshly peeled
  nuts with foil to retain the warmth they gained in blanching or
  roasting; wrap previously peeled nuts in foil and warm them in a
  200-degree F. oven for 15 minutes.

      Title: CATALAN SHREDDED SALT COD SALAD
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Salt cod -- boneless, dried
      1 sm Red or green bell pepper --
           Prepared
    1/2 lg Red onion -- thinly sliced
      1 lg Tomato -- thinly sliced
    1/3 c  Fruity Spanish olive oil
    1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
      4 lg Garlic cloves -- finely
           Chopped
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 c  Oil cured black olives
      3    Hardboiled eggs --
           Quartered
    1/2 sm Bunch oregano leaves- finely
           -chopped
 
  To prepare the salt cod, rinse it well and then immerse it in a
  container of cold water (cut into chunks, if necessary, to fit).
  Refrigerate, changing the soaking water 5 or 6 times, until softened
  and mild (24 to 48 hours, depending on how stiff and salty it was to
  begin with).
  
  Drain the cod, place it in a large saucepan with the onion and the bay
  leaves, and cover with cold water. Bring just to a boil, reduce the
  heat to very low, and cover (taste the water at this stage and, if it
  seems excessively salty, then drain, cover again with fresh cold
  water, and bring to a boil). Simmer very gently until the fish is
  opaque and plumped, and falls apart into heavy flakes when prodded,
  about 20 minutes. Drain, pat dry, and remove the bones and skin, if
  necessary. Separate into large flakes and use right away, or
  refrigerate for up to 2 days before continuing with the recipe.
  
  Drain and press the cod with your fingers to extract as much water as
  possible. Shred the cod by hand into thin strips and transfer it to a
  large bowl.
  
  Core, seed and wash the pepper.  Cut into thin rings. Separate rings
  of onion. Select 1 large, firm, ripe tomato and slice it thinly.
  
  Add the pepper rings, onion, and tomato to the bowl and toss together
  gently. In another bowl, combine the oil, vinegar, garlic, pepper,
  and if desired, a little salt (the salt cod is usually still quite
  salty; taste it to determine if the vinaigrette needs any salt).
  Whisk the vinaigrette together until thoroughly blended.
  
  Using your hands, toss the salad with the vinaigrette until all the
  ingredients are coated. Transfer the salad to a platter and garnish
  the edges with olives and wedges of hardboiled egg. Scatter the
  oregano over the dish.  Yields 6 servings

      Title: CATFISH IN RED CURRY SAUCE
 Categories: Fish, Catfish, Curry, Stove top
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Red curry paste
      4 tb Peanut oil
      2 c  Coconut milk
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
      3 tb Fish sauce
      2 lb Dressed catfish cut in
           Steaks
      1 tb Substitute Italian basil
      1    3 fresh hot chilies chopped
 
  Heat the curry paste in oil, stirring for about 2 minutes over med
  heat. Add 1/4 cup of coconut milk and the fish sauce and simmer
  slowly for another 2 minutes. Add the salt, sugar and the rest of the
  coconut milk. Bring to a boil and, as soon as the sauce boils, add
  the fish. DO NOT STIR THE FISH UNTIL THE SAUCE RETURNS TO A BOIL.
  Chai says that if you disturb the fish before the sauce boils it will
  acquire a strong aroma. Simmer the fish until done, about 5 minutes.
  Let the dish sit for at least 15 minutes (or even as long as
  overnight in the refrigerator) so the curry flavor permeates the
  fish. Reheat, without boiling, and just before serving add the basil
  leaves and chilies. Serve over rice.
  
  RED CURRY PASTE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 5 dried red chilies, seeded, soaked
  in warm water and drained salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 2

      Title: CATHE'S BURGUNDY-MUSHROOM GRAVY
 Categories: Condiments, Holiday, Cathe
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      4 tb Butter
      1 lb Mushrooms (fresh), cleaned,
           -trimmed and sliced thinly
      1 lg Onion, finely chopped
      1 c  Burgundy wine
           -(or other red wine)
      4 tb Flour
     10 oz Chicken broth (canned)
      1 c  Water (more as needed)
    1/2 ts Garlic flakes, dried
 
  Melt the butter in a small pan (about 1-quart size). Add the
  mushrooms to the pan and cook over medium heat until all the liquid
  that cooks out of them has evaporated and you just have the oil from
  the butter (in the pan with the mushrooms). Stir frequently so they
  brown, but do not burn.
  
  Add the chopped onion and red wine.  Continue cooking until all the
  liquid has cooked out (you are left with just the oil from the butter
  in the pan, with the mushrooms and onions). IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT
  THERE BE NO LIQUID LEFT IN THE PAN OTHER THAN THE OIL FROM THE
  BUTTER. (The onions may cook down until you can't see them.)
  
  Add the flour to the mushroom mixture.  Stir well so that the oil
  from the butter is absorbed by the flour. Add the entire can of
  chicken broth at once and stir well. The broth and the flour/butter
  mixture should combine to make a thick liquid. This may not thicken
  until it starts to boil. Stir constantly, or the mixture will stick
  to the bottom of the pan.
  
  Add enough water to make the gravy have a consistency you like. I
  like mine thick, so a cup of water is enough. Lower the heat. Add the
  dried minced garlic and cook over low heat until the garlic flakes
  absorb enough liquid to no longer be crunchy.

  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  When Cathe first gave me this recipe (mid '80s), it said to saute
  the onion in 1 T olive oil (then remove onions). Then cook only *1/2
  pound* of mushrooms in the oil, and add 1/4 t garlic salt (no garlic
  flakes). The recipe said to brown the mushrooms until no juice was
  left and mushrooms were "squeaky." Then add half the wine, cook down,
  add rest of wine, and cook down.
  
  Return onions and add just *1 tablespoon* of butter; stir in *1/4
  cup* of flour, stirring frequently, till very brown. Then it said to
  add half the chicken broth, mix well, add rest, and cook at "gentle
  bubble" till thickened.
  
  "If too thick, add up to 1/2 cup of water; cook at slow bubble till
  flour taste is gone."

      Title: CATHE'S CAJUN STUFFING
 Categories: Entrees, Holiday, Cathe
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 lb Jimmy Dean sage sausage
      1 lg Bell pepper, chopped
           -into 1/4" to 1/2" pieces
           Green onions (large bunch),
           -cut into 1/4" thick pieces
           Parsley (1/3 bunch), fresh,
           -chopped finely
      2 md Celery stalks, cut
           -lengthwise into 3 sticks,
           -then cut into pieces
           -1/4" thick
    1/2 c  Butter
      1 lb Shrimp, peeled and
           -de-veined, but not cooked
  2 3/4 c  Water
      1 ts Garlic flakes (dried)
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper flakes
           -(crushed), or more to
           -taste (we use about 1 T)
      1 pk Pepperidge Farm Cornbread
           -stuffing mix (cellophane
           -bag, brown-labelled)
      1 pk Pepperidge Farm Herb
           -Stuffing Mix (cellophane
           -bag, blue-labelled)
 
  In a large pot or Dutch oven (at least 6-quart),cook the sausage over
  medium heat until lightly-browned, breaking it up into small pieces.
  Saute the vegetables in the sausage drippings in the pot with the
  cooked sausage. The vegetables will brown lightly while the sausage
  gets browner than it was. Add the butter to the pot and stir the
  pieces around until they are melted.
  
  Add the shrimp and cook for 3 or 4 minutes, stirring constantly. The
  shrimp should turn pink all over and be done, but just barely done.
  Break one in half and make sure it is opaque in the center. Turn the
  heat off, but leave the pot on the burner. Add the 2 3/4 C water, the
  dried garlic and the cayenne pepper flakes; stir well.
  
  Add both bags of stuffing mix to the liquid mixture. Blend all
  ingredients together well.  Lightly spoon the stuffing mixture into a
  greased 9" x 14" pan. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 15 minutes. Serve at
  once (with Burgundy mushroom gravy, if desired).

      Title: CATHE'S CLAM CHOWDER
 Categories: Soups, Cathe
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      6 sl Bacon (or more)
      1 lg Onion, chopped
     24 oz Clam juice, bottle
           -(Doxee brand)
    1/2 ts Garlic, dried, minced
      1 lg Potato, baking
     10 oz Baby clams, canned
           -(Orleans brand)
      3 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Half & half (or more)
           -(or cream )
      1 ts Garlic salt (Lowry's)
    1/4 ts Black pepper
 
  Fry bacon in 3-quart pan until brown.  Reserve 2 T. bacon grease in
  pan; remove bacon to paper towel to drain well. Crumble bacon and
  save it for later. (Can cook bacon in microwave and transfer 2 T
  grease to 3-quart pan.)
  
  Saute chopped onion in bacon grease until translucent. Shake one of
  the three bottles of clam juice well; add to the sauteed onion. Stir
  in dried minced garlic and let come to a boil. Boil until the liquid
  is reduced by half, but don't let the liquid get so low that the
  sauteed onion and minced garlic brown.
  
  Shake the other two bottles of clam juice well and add to the mixture
  in the pan.  Bring to boil.
  
  Scrub the baking potato well (or peel it, if you want to); cut it into
  half-inch cubes.  Add to the boiling clam juice and reduce heat (to
  low) -- so the mixture bubbles gently -- until the potatoes are
  almost done.
  
  Meanwhile, drain the baby clams, reserving the juice in a cup. Put the
  clams aside.  Stir the cornstarch into the reserved clam juice,
  blending well.
  
  When the potatoes are just barely done, remove the pan from the heat.
  Re-mix the cornstarch and clam juice and add to the soup, stirring
  constantly as you pour the cornstarch mixture into the pan. Return
  pan to heat and stir constantly until thickened. (This may seem too
  thick.) Remove from heat and stir in the baby clams and the crumbled
  bacon. Add half and half or cream until soup is the consistency you
  want it. (If you don't want it so creamy, use milk or skim milk
  instead.)
  
  Add garlic salt and black pepper to taste; serve warm. Do not let the
  soup boil once the baby clams are added; boiling will turn them into
  rubber. This makes about a quart of soup, enough to serve 4 with no
  leftovers.
  
  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  The recipe that Cathe gave me in the 70s called for only two
  bottles of clam juice (instead of three), 1/2 C half & half (instead
  of 1/4 C), 2 T cornstarch (instead of 3 T), 2 teaspoons minced garlic
  (instead of 1/2 t), 1/4 t garlic salt (instead of 1 t), and no black
  pepper or bacon (just 2 T drippings for frying).
  
  It also called for 1/4 t each lemon pepper and sweet basil, 2 t dried
  parsley, 3 drops Tabasco sauce and 1/4 C sauterne, none of which are
  called for in this recipe. The only things the same are the potato,
  the onion and the 10 oz. can for baby clams (Geisha). (The recipe
  said you could substitute a 7 oz can of minced clams if you had to.)

      3 lb Red kidney beans, dry
           -or light red beans,
           -or cranberry beans
           Water to cover
    3/4 lb Ham trimmings, lean
           -or 6 ham hocks
      6 c  Water (more as needed)
      2 c  Celery, finely chopped
      2 c  Onion, finely chopped
      2 c  Bell pepper, finely chopped
      5    Bay leaves
      2 ts White pepper
      2 ts Thyme
      2 ts Oregano
      2 ts Garlic powder
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper, ground
           -(or more)
    1/2 ts Black pepper, ground
    1/2 ts Tabasco sauce (or more)
      2 lb Manda's sausage (spicy)
           -or Jimmy Dean Mesquite
           -link sausage, regular,
           -sliced diagonally
           -into 1/2-inch pieces
      8 c  Rice, cooked (or more)
 
  Empty the beans into a 6-quart saucepan.  Run water over them,
  washing them with your hands and picking out any stones or bad beans.
  Drain and repeat until the water runs clear and has no sand in it.
  
  Add water to the pot to cover the beans by about 4 inches. Place on a
  large burner and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat
  slightly, boil gently for 3 minutes, remove from burner and cover.
  Let the covered pot sit, unopened, for an hour.  Drain and reserve
  the beans, discarding the juice.
  
  Place the ham pieces, 2 cups of water, the chopped vegetables and
  seasonings in a 12-quart saucepan or large dutch oven. Stir well,
  cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer
  until the meat is fork tender, about an hour, stirring occasionally.
  
  Remove the meat from the pan and tear it into small pieces. Set it
  aside. (If using ham hocks, cover with water to cook. The beans will
  have to cook down longer to reach their normal consistency. You may
  not need to add any extra water.)
  
  Add the drained beans and 2 cups water to the pan with the ham broth
  and vegetables.  Bring to a boil over medium heat, reduce heat and
  simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the sliced sausage and
  2 cups more water if the beans are not covered with liquid and
  continue simmering until the beans start breaking into pieces, about
  35 more minutes, stirring often to the bottom of the pan.
  
  If the beans start to scorch, do not stir.  Instead, immediately
  remove them from the heat and transfer them to another pot without
  scraping any scorched beans into the mixture. Add the ham pieces or
  hocks and cook about 10 minutes more, stirring often. Do not let the
  mixture get dried out like refried beans, but keep it thicker than
  cream soup.
  
  To serve, mound 1/2 cup cooked rice in a bowl and cover with beans,
  ham and sausage pieces.  Serves 15 to 20 as a side dish.
  
  Cathe's notes:
  
  *  Adapted from Chef Paul's, page 190
  
  *  The original recipe had approximately the same amount of
  vegetables, ham and spices as above, but had just one pound of beans.
  I added one extra pound of sausage and 2 extra pounds of beans, but
  kept everything else the same.  The original recipe had
  proportionally much more cayenne pepper and Tabasco sauce. Normally I
  would make this a lot spicier than this, but not as spicy as the
  original recipe.

      3 tb Sauterne wine
    1/4 c  Bread crumbs
      3 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Half and half
      3 tb Parmesan cheese
 
  Pop stems out of shrooms (don't tear cups).  Cut stems up finely.
  Saute shrooms and onions in butter (or olive oil) slowly, over
  medium-low heat, until limp; be careful not to let mixture burn.
  
  Add clam juice and wine; cook slowly until most of the liquid has
  evaporated.  Add bread crumbs to shroom mixture in pan; mix well.
  Should be quite dry.
  
  Add half and half until mixture has a good texture, like slightly
  dampish clay for hand-building pottery. Add parmesan.
  
  Fill mushroom caps with mixture (will have to mound). Bake in toaster
  oven at 250 degrees F. until mushrooms start looking shriveled and
  ooze juice, getting brown. If unsure, taste.
  
  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  Don't cut mushrooms too finely.
  
  *  Try adding crumbled bacon to mixture.

      Title: CATHY'S FISH & RICE
 Categories: Rice
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 lb White fish (I used frozen
           Pollock), cut in
      1 sm Onion -- chopped
      3    Cloves garlic
           Handful cherry tomatoes
           -halved
           Some mushrooms -- sliced
           Flour (for dredging)
           Oil (for sauteing)
    110 ml White wine
           Curry powder
           Black pepper
           Cooked rice
 
  1.  Saute the onions in a small amount of oil till they start to
  soften. Add the garlic and cook for a few minutes, and then add the
  mushrooms and cook for a few minutes more, till they lose their raw
  look.
  
  2.  Meanwhile, put a few tablespoons of flour and the pepper into a
  plastic bag and shake the fish cubes in the bag (don't forget to
  close the bag!) Remove the fish from the bag, shaking off any excess
  flour.
  
  3.  When the vegetables are cooked to your liking, remove them from
  the pan and set them aside. You could drain them on a paper towel to
  remove a bit of the oil, but it's not necessary.
  
  4.  Add a little more oil to the pan, and heat it for a moment. Drop
  the fish pieces in the oil, and saute them till them start to turn
  opaque. Add the vegetables, the cherry tomatoes & the curry powder,
  and stir to mix them in. Pour in the white wine (or other liquid of
  your choice) and cook down till most of the liquid has evaporated.
  Serve over rice.
  
  Author's Notes: This is a recipe I made up the other night, when I
  didn't feel like going out to the store. It's not exactly haute
  cuisine, but it tasted OK, and used common ingredients. It'squick to
  prepare, and doesn't taste very fishy since the dominant flavor is
  the curry powder. (All measurements are approximate. This made more
  than enough for 2 people).
  
  The thing about this sort of recipe is that you can vary it in
  countless ways ~- add some bell peppers if you want, or add different
  spices. Use soy sauce and call it Oriental. Add a few hot chilli
  peppers for more punch.
  
  Difficulty    : easy. Precision
  : measure ingredients.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 c  Feta cheese, drained,
           Crumbled, and packed into
           The measuring cup
    1/2 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
           Flour
      1    Egg, beaten
      6    Bay leaves
      2 tb Honey
 
     1) Put the cheese into a medium sized mixing bowl. Mash well with
  the fingers until it becomes a smooth, lumpless paste. Add the flour
  and mix well with the fingers. Add the beaten egg and mix well. The
  dough will be rather sticky.
  
     2) Divide the dough into two equal parts, then form two round,
  flat, 1/2 inch thick loaves.  Lay each on three bay leaves set on a
  greased baking sheet, and bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 1
  to 1-1/2 hours, or until cooked through.
  
     3) Remove the loaves from the oven, spread the tops with the
  honey, and let cool.  Remove the bay leaves before serving. NOTE: If
  feta cheese is unavailable, use 1 cup cottage cheese and add 1/4 cup
  extra flour (but the taste is inferior).

      Title: CATO'S GRAPE BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
           Flour
    1/2 c  Lard, shortening, or butter
           Melted and cooled
    1/4 c  Feta cheese, crumbled and
           Mashed into a paste
      1 ts Cumin seed, ground
      1 ts Anise, ground
  1 1/2 c  Grape juice, purple or white
      1 pk Dry yeast
      8    Bay leaves
 
     1) Place the flour, lard, mashed cheese, ground cumin and anise,
  and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Blend well. Add the grape juice and
  mix the dough well for 2-3 minutes until all the grape juice is
  absorbed and evenly distributed.  The dough will be damp and sticky,
  but no internal dry areas should appear by the end of the mixing. If
  they do, mix a few minutes more or add a little more grape juice and
  mix again.
  
     2) Let the dough rest 5 minutes.  Now sprinkle 1 or 2 tbsp. flour
  over the dough and knead, either in the bowl or on a lightly floured
  surface for 5-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic and
  only slightly sticky.  Add more flour if needed.  Let the dough rest
  2 minutes.
  
     3) The dough should now be very smooth and easy to handle. Knead 30
  seconds more, return the dough to the bowl, cover the bowl with a dish
  towel or large plate, and let rise at room temperature for at least 3
  hours.
  
     4) Sprinkle top with flour, punch down, and form the dough into 4
  rectangular loaves (4 in. by 2 in. by 2-1/2 in.). Place two bay
  leaves on the bottom of each loaf, and lay them, leaf side down, on a
  greased cookie sheet.  Cover with a towel and let rise for 1 hour,
  until well risen.
  
     5) Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35 minutes, until the
  loaves are brown on top and make a hollow sound when tapped on the
  bottom. Serve when cool. NOTE: To make these breads without
  leavening, omit the yeast, knead the dough thoroughly, then bake at
  350 degrees for about 2 hours. They will be chewy and moist, and very
  foreign to our taste. The Romans thought unleaven bread was manlier
  and much better for the digestion.

      Title: CATSUP [KETCHUP] HISTORY
 Categories: Hints/info
      Yield: 1 Info file
 
MMMMM--------------------------HISTORY-------------------------------
 
  KETCHUP: Also catchup, Catsup. A condiment consisting of a thick,
  smooth-textured, spicy sauce usually made from tomatoes.[Probably
  Malay kechap, fish sauce possibly from Chinese (Cantonese) ke-tsiap]
  
  Notes: The word ketchup exemplifies the types of modifications that
  can take place in the borrowing process, both in the borrowing of a
  word and in the borrowing of a substance. The source of our word
  ketchup may be the Malay word kechap, possibly taken into Malay from
  the Cantonese dialect of Chinese. Kechap, like our word, referred to
  a kind of sauce, but a sauce without tomatoes; rather, it contained
  fish brine, herbs, and spices. The sauce seems to have emigrated to
  Europe by way of sailors, where it was made with locally available
  ingredients such as the juice of mushrooms or walnuts. At some point,
  when the juice of tomatoes was first used, ketchup as we know it was
  born. However, it is important to realize that in the 18th and 19th
  centuries ketchup was a generic term for sauces whose only common
  ingredient was vinegar. The word is first recorded in English in 1690
  in the form catchup, in 1711 in the form ketchup, and in 1730 in the
  form catsup. These three spelling variants of a foreign borrowing
  remain current.

      2    Cloves garlic, finely ch.
  1 1/2 ts Grated fresh root ginger
      2 tb Roasted peanuts, finely ch.
    1/2 ts Turmeric

    2/3 tb Oil
      1    Large cauliflower (about
           2lb.3oz.cut into florets)
           Juice of 1/2 lemon
 
  Toast the sesame seeds then the cumin seeds in a frypan, without any
  added oil.  The sesame seeds are ready when they are golden brown,
  and the cumin seeds when they pop, smell good, and have all heated
  through, in 1-2 minutes if you start with a hot pan. Grind the
  toasted sesame and cumin seeds, separately or mixed.
  :       Mix the toasted seeds, garlic, ginger and peanuts, adding the
  turmeric, chilli powder, ground cloves and salt, and put aside. Chop
  the onions and put them in a large pot or pan to cook in the oil.
  Cook until transparent and lightly coloured, taking care not to let
  them burn. Stir the spice mixture through the onion, then add the
  cauliflower which has been broken and cut into florets, each the size
  of a walnut.
  :       Add the lemon juice and about 1/4 cup of water, cover, and
  cook over a moderate heat , stirring and tossing the cauliflower
  occasionally, until it is tender-crisp. Add a little extra water
  during cooking if necessary.  If you find that there is liquid left
  when the cauliflower is cooked, thicken it with a little cornflour
  paste and toss the cauliflower in it. Taste and add extra salt if
  necessary. Serve with dahl, rice, a tomato salad, cucumbers in
  yoghurt and toasted coconut.

      2    Garlic cloves; sliced
      1 sm Bunch of coriander, chopped
 
  A superb way of cooking cauliflower, given to me by a Lebanese chef.
  The florets are stir-fried with olive oil, garlic and lots of fresh
  coriander, and the result is irresistible.
  
  Cut the cauliflower into tiny florets. Heat the olive oil gently and
  saut the sliced garlic in it until soft, about 2-3 minutes. Turn the
  heat up and stir-fry the cauliflower florets for a further 2-3
  minutes, tossing so that they are well coated with the oil. Turn the
  heat down, partially cover with a lid, and cook until soft, about 4
  minutes. Stir in the chopped coriander, toss for 1 minute more, and
  serve.

      Title: CAULIFLOWER SOUP (MINESTRA DI CAVALFIORE)
 Categories: Italian, Soups/stews, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lg Head cauliflower
      2 tb White or cider vinegar
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      4    To 6 cloves garlic
    1/4 ts To 1/2 tsp hot pepper flakes
      3 c  Hot meat broth
           Salt
    1/3 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      6 oz Freshly grated pecorino
           -cheese
 
  "There's probably no sense in making this soup if you don't like
  cauliflower.  As with so much Italian food, this recipe uses a few
  basic ingredients to showcase the star vegetable. A purist would even
  shudder at the cheese!  Make this soup as garlicky and spicy as you
  like but be sure to serve lots of crusty Italian bread or bruschetta
  (toasted Italian bread brushed with olive oil). When I want a soup
  with a bit more texture, I remove 1 cup of the cooked cauliflower,
  puree it, and return it to the remaining soup"
  
  Break the cauliflower florets into small (1/2 inch) pieces. Trim the
  stem end and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Wash the cauliflower in 2
  quarts of cold water blended with 2 tablespoons of vinegar.  Drain
  and drop into a large pot of boiling salted water. Boil for 4
  minutes; drain and dry well.
  
  Heat the olive oil in a soup pot; add the garlic and hot pepper, and
  cook gently until the garlic is golden. Add the cauliflower and cook
  for 5 minutes, stirring to prevent it from browning. Add the hot
  broth, salt and parsley and cook until the cauliflower is tender.
  Ladle into soup bowls and sprinkle with a generous amount of cheese.
  
  Serves 6.

  heat. Add vegetable oil and garlic and allow to sit for 5 minutes,
  keeping warm.
  
  Pour butter into large baking tray with sides.  Spread dried chick
  peas on tray.  Bake 15 minutes, turning frequently, or until chick

      Title: CECIL'S JERK CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Spice mix
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Caribbian hot sauce -- OR
     10    Habaneros
           Pureed in 1/4 cup cheap --
           Yellow mustard
      2 tb Dried rosemary
      2 tb Dried basil
      3    Scallions
      1 ts Salt
           Juice of 2 limes
      2 tb White vinegar
      2 tb Parsley
      2 tb Dried thyme
      2 tb Mustard seed
      1 ts Black pepper
      2 tb Orange juice
      6    Chicken thighes -- w/legs
           Attached
           Chopped
 
  Combine all ingredients except chicken in food processor or blender,
  and blend into a paste, making sure that the ingredients are all fully
  integrated. The paste should be the consistency of a thick tomato
  sauce. If its too thick, thin it with a little more white vinegar.
  
  Cover the paste and let it sit in the refrigerator for at least 2
  hours, but not more that 2 weeks, for the flavors to blend together.
  Overnight is ideal.
  
  Rub the chicken with the paste and place over a very low heat. Or if
  you have a covered cooker, put the coals to one side, the chicken to
  the other and cover.
  
  Cook about 1 hr without cover  or 1/2 hr if covered. The key here is
  to use a very low heat.  Be patient. Hard to overcook, the only way
  to screw it up is if you burn the paste by having the heat to high.
  The longer the chicken stays on the grill, the more superior the
  smoky flavor. Recipe By : Cecil AT From: Western Mexican Cookbook

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Center-cut salmon, cut
           --almost all the way through
           --into 6 steaks
      1    Lemon, thinly sliced
           Salt & pepper
           Sprigs of fresh dill
      6 tb Butter, melted
           Cedar pieces (see below)*
 
  *Untreated cedar pieces are sold by the bundle at most lumberyards
  and some hardware stores. Soak untreated cedar pieces (1 piece about
  6' x 12", 6 pieces about 3" x 6") in a pan of water overnight or
  place in a large pot of water and bring to a boil over med-high heat.
  Drain.
  
  Preheat oven to 450 F.  Place large cedar board on a foil-lined cookie
  sheet.  Season salmon with salt and pepper, then lay it on the cedar
  and slip smaller cedar pieces, a few lemon slices, and a few dill
  sprigs (reserve some lemon and dill for garnish) between each steak.
  Brush all over with butter.
  
  Roast until salmon is pink, 20-25 minutes.  Remove salmon from oven.
  Take smaller pieces of cedar out from between steaks and scatter over
  salmon, then wrap tightly with foil and set aside to finish "cooking"
  ~ and to set smoky flavor - for 15 mintues.  (For a more well-done
  fish, return wrapped salmon to oven and roast for 5 minutes.) Unwrap,
  and, when salmon is cool enough to handle, finish slicing the fish.
  Serve steaks garnished with reserved lemon slices and fresh dill, if
  desired.

    1/2 c  Whipping cream
           Peppered croutons-see recipe
 
  Melt butter in heavy large non-aluminum pot over medium heat. Add
  onion and celery and saute until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.
  Add celery roots, potatoes and parsnips and saute 5 minutes. Add 3
  cups stock, bay leaf, thyme, white pepper and coriander. Bring to
  boil. Reduce heat, cover partially and simmer until vegetables are
  very soft, about 25 minutes. Discard bay leaf and thyme sprigs.  Add
  spinach to soup and cook until just wilted, stirring occasionally,
  about 2 minutes.
  
  Place soup in batches in processor.  Return soup to pot. Add cream and
  remaining 2 cups stock and simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  Season with salt and white pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.
  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to simmer before continuing.)
  
  Ladle soup into bowls.  Sprinkle with croutons and serve.
  
  "The Irish excel with root vegetables, and every home garden seems to
  boast lush rows of celeriac, parsnips, turnips, leeks, rutabagas, and
  potatoes. This savory bisque is a subtle and suave use of the humble
  and often ignored celery root. Along with glasses of sherry, it makes
  a great beginning to an elegant celebration of St. Patrick. Spinach
  leaves add pretty green color to the bisque."

      1/2 c  diced Spanish onion
        6 ts olive oil
        2 lg celery roots -- peeled

        1    clove garlic
        1    sprig rosemary
        1    stalk celery -- diced
        1 TB diced shallots
        2 TB chopped fresh herbs (e.g.
  :          parsley, chives)
        2 c  flat-leaf parsley leaves
        1    recipe Red Wine Reduction
  :          -recipe follows
  
  In a medium saucepan, caramelize the carrots, celery, and onion in 2
  teaspoons of the olive oil. Add the celery root, cover three-quarters
  of the way with water, and cover the pan. Slowly braise for 45 to 60
  minutes, or until tender. Remove the celery root from the braising
  liquid and cool completely. Reserve the braising liquid. Trim the
  celery root to square off- and slice paper thin. Clean the Portobello
  mushrooms by removing the stems and the dark brown underside. Cut
  into quarters, season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with 2
  teaspoons of the olive oil. Place in an ovenproof pan with the garlic
  and rosemary and cover with aluminum foil. Bake at 350 degrees for 30
  to 40 minutes, or until tender. In a medium saute pan, saute the
  diced celery and shallot in 1 teaspoon of the olive oil. Dice the
  roasted mushrooms and toss with the celery mixture and herbs. In a
  saute pan, wilt the Italian parsley in 1 teaspoon of the olive oil
  and 1 tablespoon of the braising liquid. Place the celery root slices
  on a sheet pan with a dash of the braising liquid, season with salt
  and pepper, and bake at 350 degrees for 3 to 4 minutes to reheat. Lay
  1 slice of the celery root on a plate and top with the mushroom and
  celery mixture. Place a piece of the parsley on top and cover with
  another piece of the celery root. Press the edges of the celery root
  together and place small pinches of braised Italian parsley at each
  corner. Drizzle with Red Wine Reduction around the edges of each
  plate.

      Title: CELERY ROOT SALAD
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Celery root
           -(also called celeriac)
      4 c  Water (salted), boiling
      6 tb Olive oil
      3 tb White wine vinegar
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Sugar
  1 1/4 ts Mustard,  dry
    1/2 ts Black pepper,
           -freshly ground
      1    Garlic clove, crushed
    3/4 ts Dill weed, dried
           -(use more if fresh)
    1/3 c  Scallions, minced
    1/3 c  Parsley, minced
 
  Peel the celery root and cut it into 1/2-inch cubes. Add the cubed
  celery root to the boiling salted water and cook until tender, about
  15 minutes. Drain.
  
  Combine the rest of the ingredients and whisk or shake to make a
  dressing. Pour the dressing over the cooked celery root and toss.
  Refrigerate at least two hours before serving.
  
  Celery root (also called celeriac) is sometimes hard to find. Try to
  get ones about the size of a large fist; smaller ones have too much
  waste, and bigger ones are often pithy. This vegetable is not worth
  eating raw.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cooked celery root in vinaigrette -- This salad has an intense
  celery flavor.  The taste is so strong that it should be served only
  with other strongly flavored foods. It would overwhelm veal, but
  would go well with a lamb roast.  Yield:  Serves 6-8.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 2 hours chilling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: CELERY ROOT SALAD (SELLERIESALAT)
 Categories: Salads, German
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 md Celery root (3-inch
           -diameter), peeled,
           Washed, and thinly sliced
      1 c  Beef stock
      2 tb To 3 tb salad oil
           Wine vinegar
           Salt
      1 pn Sugar
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped
 
  Put the freshly sliced celery root immediately into the stock which
  should be flavored with 1 tablespoon each oil and vinegar, 1/2
  teaspoon salt, the sugar, and the chopped onion. Cook for about 20
  minutes - until the celery root is quite tender and the liquid has
  almost boiled away. Season the celery root and beef stock with the
  remaining oil and a dash or two of wine vinegar, as well as with salt
  if you wish.
  
  Note:  If the salad is to be served as an appetizer, mix in some
  coarsely chopped walnut and garnish with a few walnut halves.
  
  Nowadays, in this age of crudites, it may be more usual to substitute
  grated uncooked celery root, marinated in oil and vinegar, and
  possibly mixed with grated raw carrot.
  
  Makes 2 - 3 cups.

  Celery Salads are easy make aheads
  
  Whether fixing family meals or planning a party menu, consider these
  easy to prepare celery salads. Crisp, colorful and quick, these
  salads can be made ahead, and to save time, start with fresh cut
  celery available at produce departments. Celery Salad a la Greece
  tastes best when it's made several hours or a day before. To
  tenderize the vegetables, first simmer in a seasoned mixture of lemon
  juice, olive oil and tarragon. Reduce the liquid. Refrigerate and use
  as a flavorful vegetable marinade. Take the sa lad from the
  refrigerator, stir and serve. Or try a crunchy celery, carrot and
  water chestnut salad. Julienne or slice celery and carrots before
  lightly cooking. Toss with sliced water chestnuts and a fragrant
  dressing of olive oil and cider vinegar blended with Dijon mustard.
  Serve immediately or marinate.
  
  In a medium saucepan, combine water, lemon juice, oil, garlic, salt
  and tarragon; bring to a boil. Add celery, carrots, red pepper and
  onion; bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until
  vegetables are crisp tender, 1012 minutes. Remove from heat; using a
  slotted spoon, transfer the vegetables to a serving bowl. Place the
  saucepan over high heat; boil the liquid until it is reduced to l/2
  cup; pour liquid over vegetables; cover and refrigerate 4 hours or
  overnight before serving. Makes 4 portio ns, about
        3    l/2 cups

      Title: CELERY SEED CIRCLES
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 50 Servings
 
      3 c  All-purpose flour
  2 1/2 ts Celery seeds
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper
      3 tb Vegetable shortening
 
         About 2/3 cup water
  
  "Celery seeds are not the seeds of the celery you eat as a vegetable.
  Rather, they are the tangy fruit of a plant related to the parsley
  family. Try them with a cold glass of fruit juice mixed with club
  soda. 350~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F.
  
  Stir together the flour, celery seeds, salt, and pepper in a large
  bowl or in the food processor. Cut in the shortening until the
  mixture is the consistency of coarse meal. Add enough of the water to
  form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, 1/8 inch thick maximum. Cut the
  dough into 2-inch circles with a cookie cutter. Arrange them on
  ungreased baking sheets.
  
  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until lightly browned. Cool on a rack.
  Yield: 40-50.
  
  VARIATION: Caraway seeds can be substituted for celery seeds. Grind
  the caraway seeds in a food mill before using. The caraway version of
  these crackers is delicious with cream cheese.

 Categories: Diabetic, Vegetables, Side dish
      Yield: 6 Sweet ones
 
      3 c  Celery; thinly sliced
    1/2 c  Carrots; grated
      1    Apple; unpeeled, cored, and
           -diced

      2 tb Sugar(used sugar substitute)
    1/2 ts Salt;
      2 tb Vinegar;
    1/2 c  Walnuts; coarsely chopped
           -(optional)
 
  Combine celery, carrots, and apples.  Thoroughly blend remaining
  ingredients and fold into celery mixture. If desired, fold in walnuts
  or sprinkle over top as a gamish. Chill at least 30 minutes before
  serving in lettuce-lined bowl.  Delightly crunchy! Food Exchange per
  serving: 1 FAT EXCHANGE + 1/4 FRUIT EXCHANGE (IF YOU USED THE BIGGEST
  APPLE EVER). I would cut this recipe down to make this be 1 fat
  exchange for me and use sugar substitute. Could be used as a  side
  dish for the vegetarian.

  stock and when boiling, turn down to a very gentle simmer. Don't
  cover, and allow to simmer until reduced to 2/3 volume. Strain and
  allow to settle, as the cepes always give out a little sand, no

 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Baking soda
      1 c  Ammonia (sudsing or
           -nonsudsing)
    1/2 c  Vinegar
     14 c  Warm water
 
  Pour baking soda into a clean gallon-size plastic jug. Add ammonia,
  vinegar and warm water to fill. Swish the jug to mix ingredients
  before it is completely full.
  
  Cover jug tightly, label and keep out of the reach of children.
  Smaller pump- type containers can be filled from the jug for small
  jobs--make sure these containers are labeled and kept safely away
  from children as well.
  
  To use:  Spray solution directly onto tile and wipe with a damp
  sponge or the kind of scrubbing pad made for Teflon pans.
  
  Hint:  If grout or tiles are especially soiled, make a past of 2 tb
  baking soda and 1 tb Ceramic Tile & Grout Cleaner (recipe above).
  Brush it onto the stains with an old toothbrush. Let past remain for
  5 minutes, then scrub off and rinse.
  
  Note: This solution contains ammonia: do not mix with anything in the
  bathroom containing bleach or dangerous fumes could result.
  
  Yield:  1 gallon
  
  This recipe safely removes the soap film that frequently forms on tile
  surfaces and between the tiles. A more concentrated paste of the
  cleaner can be made (see Hint) and left to clean stubborn stains on
  the grout.

 Categories: Loo, Vegetables, Polish
      Yield: 3 -4 as a si
 
      3 c  Rendered pork fat
           -(trimmed from
           -chops or roast)
           Finely chopped onions
           Paprika
      1 md Head red cabbage
           Salt
    1/2 ts Paprika
           Fresh ground black pepper
      1 lg Apple, grated
      2 tb White [sic] vinegar
      1 tb White sugar
    1/2 ts Caraway seeds
 
  Render pork fat very slowly; remove "cracklings", & add enough finely
  chopped onion for taste and flavor. Cook until golden. Add paprika
  slowly, DON'T let it burn or smoke. Let cool, and store, covered in
  refrigerator - will keep for a long time.
  
  Wash the cabbage in cold water, quarter it & chop finely, salting as
  you go. Discard the core. Heat about 3 cups of the pork-fat/onion
  mixture, add about 1/2 teasp. paprika - don't let it burn. Add the
  wet, salty cabbage & stir until it's coated with fat. Add pepper to
  taste, grated apple, stir in; add about 2-3 tsps wine [sic] vinegar,
  1 tbsp sugar. Rub about 1 1/2 tsp caraway seeds between palms, & add
  to cabbage.
  
  This totally "handed-down-through-the-Wincenc-family" recipe will
  come out differently each time - until you arrive at the taste you
  like best. Taste as you go along! But the true test will be on the
  2nd or 3rd day when reheating the left-overs. I always loved it best
  then!!

  O'Brien's, 3011 N. St. Mary's, San Antonio, Tx NOTE: Ceviche, or
  Seviche, comes originally from Polynesia and has undergone changes
  that make it a Mexican dish. Mexicans perfer to use fat fish as
  mackerel or pompano for ceviche. Limes are preferred, although lemons
  may be used, since both contain the citric acid that "cooks" the

           -HWDP78B    CHERYL GAVARD
    1/2 c  Warm water
      1 ts Sugar
      1 pk Dry active yeast
           -Combine these and let sit
           -for later use
      1 ts -warm water
        pn Saffron
      3 c  Flour; up 2 4 cups
      3 lg Eggs; or subs.
    1/3 c  Veg. oil
      3 tb Honey
      2 tb OJ
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1    Beaten egg; set aside
 
  Combine these 2  ingredients and let sit in warm place until it
  bubbles and foams. "proofing the yeast"
  
  Sift 2 1/2 cups of the flour into a glass bowl.  Make a well in the
  center and add the yeast, 3 eggs, veg. oil, honey, OJ, salt, and
  saffron. Beat either with dough hooks, or by hand until well mixed
  and a soft dough is formed.  Start to add more flour and knead it in
  until you get a non-sticky dough ball.
  
  Turn out onto floured surface and knead it for ten mins. until very
  elastic. 3-5 mins.
  
  Oil a bowl and place the dough ball in it and coat well. Cover and
  let rise in warm place for 1 1/2 hrs. Punch down. Let stand covered
  for 1 hour. Punch down.
  
  Remove to floured board and shape into a round by rolling on the board
  until it is a rope about 18-22"'s long. Curl it up and place on oiled
  sheet and cover and let stand for 1 hour or until double. Brush with
  beaten egg and bake at 375 for 15 mins. lower to 350 and bake for 25
  mins. more or until golden and hollow sounding when thumped on botton.
  
  Now if you want you can sprinkle on seeds of your choice before
  baking and after brushing with the egg. Or you can add rasins to the
  bread, by flattening it, and patting on rasins and then rolling it up
  jelly roll style and then forming  it into the round. You can also
  bake it in a braid by splitting the dough into three pieces, and
  rolling each 20 "'s long pinch one end together and "braid" the
  ropes. Pinch the other end. Then follow the directions for baking. I
  hope you all try this bread as it is relly great. It can also be used
  as Easter bread and have candied fruit added to it and then glazed
  with a powder sugar glaze and sprinkle on collored jimmies. If anyone
  bakes this bread please let me know how it goes:) TTYL

      3    Eggs

MMMMM-------------------ASSEMBLING AND FRYING------------------------
    1/2 c  Sugar
     80 sm Rounds of rice paper (banh
           -trang), each 6 1/2 inches
           -in diameter
           Peanut oil, for frying
 
  This is another version of the superlative Cha Gio (also called
  Nems). The filling here is a bit more elaborate than in the first
  one. Boil the noodles. Prepare the Nuoc Cham and Vegetable Platter.
  Set aside.
  
  Prepare the filling:  Soak the two types of mushrooms in hot water
  until soft, about 30 minutes.  Drain. Remove the stems from the
  mushrooms and squeeze to extract the liquid. Mince the mushrooms.
  Combine the mushrooms with the remaining filling ingredients in a
  large bowl. Mix with your hands to blend.  Set aside.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.  The rice paper sheets are brittle and must
  be handled with care. (The water is used to soften the sheets for
  handling. Sweetening the water helps the rice paper turn a deep
  golden color when fried and also produces crisper rolls.) Work with
  only 4 sheets of rice paper at a time, keeping the remaining sheets
  covered with a barely damp cloth to prevent curling. One at a time,
  immerse a sheet in the warm water. Quickly remove it and spread flat
  on a dry towel. Do not let the sheets touch each other.  The rice
  paper will become pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion. Press into a
  compact rectangle. Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then
  the other side. Roll from bottom to top to completely enclose the
  filling. Continue until all of the mixture is used.
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2
  inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325F. Working in batches,
  add some of the rolls to each skillet, but do not crowd or let them
  touch, or they will stick together.  Fry over moderate heat for 10 to
  12 minutes, turning often, until golden and crisp. Remove the rolls
  with tongs and drain on paper towels. Keep warm in a low oven while
  frying the remaining rolls.
  
  Traditionally, Cha Gio is served with the accompaniments suggested in
  this recipe.
  
  To eat, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with a few
  strands of noodles and a variety of other ingredients from the
  Vegetable Platter before dipping it in the Nuoc Cham. If served as an
  hors d'ouvre, allow 4 or 5 rolls per person; serve 8 to 10 as a main
  course.
  
  NOTE:  Another popular way of serving this dish is to divide the
  noodles and elements of the Vegetable Platter evenly among the
  individual bowls. Top each with cut-up pieces of Cha Gio, ground
  roasted peanuts and Nuoc Cham.
  
  As a quick and easy appetizer, Cha Gio can be served with just Nuoc
  Cham.
  
  Yield: about 80 spring rolls.

     20    Sheets dried rice papers (ba

      4    Eggs; well beaten
      2 c  Oil, peanut
 
  Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and set aside. Cut a round
  rice paper sheet into quarters. Place the cut rice paper on a flat
  surface. With a pastry brush, paint beaten egg over the entire
  surface of each of the pieces. Before filling, wait for egg mixture
  to take effect, softening the wrappers; this takes about 2 minutes.
  When you become adept at this, you can work on several wrappers at a
  time. When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about 1 tsp.
  of filling near the curved side, in the shape of a rectangle. Fold
  the sides over to enclose the filling and continue to roll. After
  filling all the wrappers, pour the oil into a large frying  pan, put
  the spring rolls into the cold oil, turn the heat to moderate, and
  fry for 20 to 30 minutes, until a lovely golden brown. (This is
  Bach's special method of keeping spring rolls crisp).

  The book notes that true Buddhist vegetarians would not use garlic or
  fish sauce and would limit the dips to plain soy or plum sauce.
  Unless you are in this category, Peanut Sauce (Nuoc Leo) and Nuoc
  Cham are great dips as well.
  
  Prepare the Vegetable Platter, noodles and dipping sauce. Set aside.
  
  Soak the noodles in warm water and the mushrooms in hot water for 30
  minutes; drain.  Cut the noodles into 1/2-inch lengths. Remove and
  discard the stems from the mushrooms; squeeze to extract most of the
  soaking liquid.  Mince all of the mushrooms.
  
  Combine all of the filling ingredients in a large mixing bowl; blend
  well with your hands.  Set aside.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a large bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.
  
  Rice paper is quite fragile.  Work with only 4 sheets at a time,
  keeping the remaining sheets covered with a barely damp cloth to
  prevent curling.
  
  Immerse the rice paper, one sheet at a time, into the sweetened warm
  water. Quickly withdraw it and lay it flat on a dry towel. Do this
  with 4 sheets without letting them touch each other. The rice paper
  will become pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold over the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion. Press it into a
  compact rectangle.  Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then
  the other side.  Roll from the bottom to the top to completely
  enclose the filling. Continue until all of the mixture is used. (The
  rolls can be prepared 1 day in advance.  Wrap and refrigerate.)
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible use 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2 inches
  of oil into each skillet and heat to 325F. Working in batches, add
  some of the rolls without letting them touch, or they will stick

  To serve, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with some
  noodles and selected items from the Vegetable Platter and dips the
  package in the dipping sauce.
  
  NOTE:  The fried rolls can be frozen, then thawed and reheated in a
  350F oven just to crisp and heat through.
  
  Yield: 40 rolls.

  And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, along comes a
  recipe for Fried Shrimp Rolls!!!  These triangular little goodies are
  great when served alongside Cha Gio. These are *really* good! Prepare
  the Nuoc Cham. Wash and dry the mint and coriander leaves.
  
  Set aside.
  
  Prepare the filling:  Soak the noodles in warm water for 30 minutes.
  Drain. Cut into 1-inch lengths.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.  Rice paper is quite fragile. Work with
  only 2 sheets at a time, keeping the remaining sheets covered with a
  barely damp cloth to prevent curling.
  
  Immerse 1 sheet of rice paper into the warm water. Remove and spread
  flat on a dry towel.  Soak a second sheet of rice paper and spread it
  out without touching the other round. The rice papers will become
  pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Place 1/2 tablespoon of the
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion. Place 1 shrimp in
  the filling, leaving the tail section extended over the fold line.
  Top the shrimp with an additional 1/2 tablespoon of filling and press
  into a compact triangle, forming a point where the tail extends (it
  is important that the filling be flat so it can be wrapped entirely
  and tightly). Fold the sides over to enclose the filling, then fold
  the remaining sides over to seal the compact triangle. The completed
  roll resembles a triangle with a handle.  Fill the remaining wrappers
  in the same manner.
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2
  inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.
  Add a few rolls to each skillet; don't let them touch or they will
  stick together. Cook over moderate heat for 10 to 12 minutes, turning
  often until crisp and golden brown. Drain the rolls on paper towels.
  Keep warm in a low oven while frying the remaining rolls.
  
  Serve the shrimp rolls as an appetizer with the Nuoc Cham, mint and
  coriander leaves.
  
  NOTE:  These rolls may be cooked in advance then reheated in a 350F
  oven for about 20 minutes, or until crisp.
  
  Yield: 24 shrimp rolls.

      Title: CHA QUE (CINNAMON PATE)
 Categories: Vietnam, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Appetizer
 
      1 lb Boneless pork (weight after
           -trimming fat), preferable
           -fresh ham
      3 tb Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
      3 tb Water
    1/2 tb Potato starch or rice flour
    1/2 ts Granulated sugar
      1 ts Baking powder
        ds MSG (optional)
           Sprinkling of freshly
           -ground black pepper
      2 oz Pork fat
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  This recipe is very tasty with an interesting texture. Unless you're
  a fan of hard work, use a food processor. The pate was originally
  pounded to the proper consistency in a mortar and pestle...  It can
  be used all sorts of ways++made into balls for soup, sliced after
  cooking and added to lettuce or rice paper rolls, served with shrimp
  chips for munchies++whatever inspires you.  The cinnamon flavor is
  discernible but not overpowering. I've actually made this recipe and
  found it to be a keeper.
  
  Be sure pork is trimmed of all fat.  Slice the meat 1/4 inch thick,
  then cut into 1 inch squares.  Make a marinade by combining all the
  remaining ingredients, except for the pork fat and cinnamon, in a
  large bowl. Add the pork slices to the marinade and mix well with
  your hands, then cover the bowl with wrap or foil. Refrigerate for 5
  hours, and after that period of time has elapsed, transfer the bowl
  to the freezer for 10 minutes.
  
  Remove the pork from the freezer, add the cinnamon, and reduce to a
  paste in a food processor only.
  
  Boil the pork fat for 10 minutes and dice into small pieces, the size
  of whole peppercorns.  Add the diced pork fat to the ground pork
  mixture.
  
  Coat an 8-inch-square baking pan with oil.  Put the meat paste into
  the pan and press down firmly with your hands, making sure the
  surface is smooth. The meat will come halfway up the side of the pan.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350F and bake the pate for 40 minutes or until the
  surface looks brown.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Then
  slice and serve as an appetizer or with French bread for lunch or
  dinner, or use in any recipe where it is required.  It can be eaten
  hot or cold.
  
  This will keep fresh in the refrigerator for a week, or it can be
  stored for a longer period in the freezer. To reheat, wrap in foil
  and place in a 300F oven for 15 minutes.

   Cut the pork into long strips 1 1/2 to 2 inches square. Mix all for
  the marinade and marinate the meat for 3 hrs., unrefrigerated, or 6
  hrs. in the refrigerator.  Turn the strips every hour or so.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350^.  Place a large cake pan half filled with
  water on the lowest shelf of your oven. This will catch drips from
  the meat and prevent smoking. Place the meat strips directly on an
  oven rack and put in the top position of the oven. Be sure that all
  of the meat is over the dripping pan. Roast for 45 minutes without
  disturbing the meat. Then, turn the heat up to 450^ and roast for an
  additional 15 minutes or until the pork strips are crisp and a rich
  brown color. Slice the meat and serve it hot or cold... or use in
  other dishes as directed.
  
  *Mein See:  The remains of the process of making soy sauce. Very rich
  soybean condiment used in many Chinese dishes. Can be found in
  Oriental markets under this name or soybean jam or condiment.

      Title: CHA SHU BOW
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------YIELD: 12 SERVINGS--------------------------
      1 ea Pk Active dry yeast
      1 c  Warm water (abt. 110 degree)
    1/3 c  Sugar
      2 ea Tb Salad oil
      1 ts Salt
      3 c  All-purpose flour; unsifted,
           - (about)
           Pork filling (directions
           - follow)
 
  DIRECTIONS: In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in water; blend in sugar,
  oil and Salt. Let stand in a warm place until bubbly (about 15 mins).
  Add flour and mix until dough holds together. Place dough on a
  lightly floured board and knead until smooth and elastic (about 8 to
  10 mins). Place in a greased bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place
  until doubled in bulk (about 1 hour 15 mins). Meanwhile, prepare pork
  filling; let cool and set aside. Turn dough out onto a lightly
  floured board and knead for 1 min. Shape into a rectangle. With a
  floured knife, cut rectangle in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise 6
  times to make 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a round about 4
  1/2" in diameter. Press outside edges of dough to make them slightly
  thinner that the rest of the round. Place about 2 tbsp of filling in
  center of each round. Pull edges of dough up around filling and twist
  to seal. Place each bun, sealed side down, on a 3" square of foil.
  Cover and let rise in a warm place until puffy and light (about 30
  mins). Set in steamer over boiling water. Cover and steam for 12 to
  15 mins. (when done, tops of buns should be glazed and smooth). Serve
  warm.
  
  Pork Filling: Cut 1 1/2 lbs boneless lean pork into 1/2" cubes.
  Season with 2 cloves garlic (minced), 1/2 tsp grated fresh ginger, 2
  tsp sugar and 2 tbsp Chinese soy sauce. In a bowl, combine 2 tsp
  sugar, 1 tbsp cornstarch, 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp dry sherry and 1/4
  cup water; reserve. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok or wide frying pan over
  high heat. When oil is hot, add pork and stirfry until browned (about
  5 mins). Add 1 medium size chopped onion and continue to stir frying
  until onion is limp (about 2 mins). Stir cornstarch mixture, add to

      Title: CHA SIU BOW (STEAMED BARBECUED PORK BUNS)
 Categories: China, Ham/pork
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Yield: 2 doz.
           -1 recipe of bun dough*

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      4 c  Barbecued pork;dice fine
    1/2 c  Dehydrated onion flakes

MMMMM-----------------------SAUCE MIXTURE----------------------------
      2 ts Hoisin sauce
      2 ts Sherry
      4 ts Oyster sauce
      2 ts Catsup
      1 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 tb Cornstarch
  1 1/2 c  Chicken stock
 
   *Recipe is included in this collection. TO MAKE FILLING: Soak onion
  flakes in a cup with just enough water to cover flakes. Mix sauce in
  a small sauce pan.
   Cook over medium high heat until sauce thickens. Stir in the diced
  pork and onion flakes. Chill 3-4 hours.
   WRAPPING: Divide filling into 24 portions. Divide dough into 24
  balls. Slightly flatten each ball then roll out into 4-inch discs,
  leaving the center of the disc twice as thick as the side. Place 1
  portion of the filling in the center of the dough. Gather up the
  sides around the filling and twist dough to seal.
   Place on a 2 inch square piece of wax paper, twist side down. Put the
  wrapped buns at least 2 inches apart on a cookie sheet and allow the
  buns to rise in a draft-free place (the oven) for another hour.
   STEAMING: Steam for 15 minutes. Turn heat off and let the steam
  subside before lifting the cover. BAKING: Cha Siu Bow can also be
  baked. Preheat oven at 350 degrees. Set buns 2 inches apart on cookie
  sheet.
   Brush with a mixture of 1 beaten egg white, 1 tsp.
   water and 1/4 tsp. sugar. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden
  brown. Brush with melted butter. DO AHEAD NOTES: Cook and freeze.
  Reheat by steaming if steam-cooked originally. Steam frozen buns for
  1/2 hour to reheat. If baked, thaw and wrap buns in foil or cover pan
  with foil and reheat in slow oven for 1/2 hour.
  
   COMMENTS: A good filling should have some pork fat mixed in with the
  lean meat. Most importantly, Cha Siu Bow filling should be very
  juicy. That's why Ms. Yee uses so much liquid in the sauce mixture.
  By chilling the filling thoroughly, the sauce, which is very thick,
  adheres to the filling much better. Ideally, when you make the
  barbecued pork, you should try to save the pork drippings and use
  them as part of the sauce mixture. Ms. Yee deliberately leaves the
  center of the dough a bit thick because, if you roll it out to an
  even thickness, the top of the bun will ended up being too thin in
  comparison to the bottom due to of the way the dough is wrapped. In a
  pinch, you may use frozen bread dough as a substitute. However,
  frozen dough works best when baked. It does not steam well.

           -Dough (recipe follows)
      1 pk Active dry yeast (1
           -tablespoon)
      3 tb Sugar
      1 c  Warm milk (100 to 110)
      1    Egg
    3/4 c  Vegetable oil
  3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour, + more
           -for dusting and kneading
 
  Reheat in a 350 degree F. oven for 5 minutes, or microwave at high
  about 1 minute.
  
  Prepare bread dough. Cut out twenty 3-inch squares of parchment
  paper. Mix together ginger, oyster sauce, hoisin, dark soy, sugar and
  water in a bowl.
  
  Heat a wok over medium-high heat. Add oil. When hot, add onion;
  stir-fry until soft. Don't brown. Add pork and stir-fry 30 seconds.
  Pour in sauce mixture, bring to a boil. Stir cornstarch/water into a
  smooth mixture. Add to pork; cook, stirring until thick, about 15
  seconds. Add sesame oil. Remove to bowl; refrigerate until thoroughly
  chilled.
  
  Cut dough in half. Form each half into a 12-inch long log; cut into 10
  pieces. Roll each piece into a 4-inch circle. Roll outer inch of each
  circle 1/8-inch thin; leave middle slightly thicker.
  
  If right-handed, place a dough circle in palm of your left hand. Put
  a big tablespoon of pork mixture in the ; middle; put left thumb over
  the pork. With your right hand, bring up edge and make a pleat in it.
  Rotate circle a little and make a second pleat. As you make each
  pleat, gently pull it up and around as if to enclose your thumb.
  Continue rotating, pleating and pinching, then gently twist into a
  spiral. Pinch to seal. Place bun pleated side down on a parchment
  square. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Put buns 1 1/2
  inches apart on a baking sheet. Let rise until doubled in size, 30
  minutes to 1 hour.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat egg yolks with water and sugar;
  brush over buns. Bake 20 minutes.
  
  Makes 20 buns.
  
  CHINESE BAKED SWEET BREAD DOUGH
  
  Chinese bread dough is quite sweet compared with Western breads (the
  further south you go in China, the sweeter the dough becomes). Most
  Chinese breads are steamed, which is why they look pale and uncooked
  to the Western eye.
  
  Put the yeast and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in a small bowl. Add 1/4
  cup of the warm milk. Let stand 5 minutes, then stir to dissolve. If
  should foam and bubble. If it does not, discard and use a fresh
  package of yeast. Stir in the egg, oil and remaining milk.
  
  Put the flour and remaining sugar in the work bowl of a food processor
  fitted with the metal blade. Process 2 seconds. With the machine
  running, pour the warm milk mixture down the feed tube in a steady
  stream. Process until it forms a rough ball. If ball is sticky and
  wet, add a little more flour. Process a few seconds longer, or until
  dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Remove dough to a
  lightly floured board.
  
  Knead dough, dusting with flour to keep it from sticking, until
  smooth and elastic, about 2 minutes. Place in a large oiled bowl,
  cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot until doubled,
  about 1 hour.
  
  Punch down dough and place on a lightly floured surface. It is now
  ready to form into rolls, buns or loaves.
  
  Makes enough for 20 barbecued pork buns. Joyce Jue, San Francisco

  TIPS
  
  In the Punjab, tomatoes are grated to make a puree - don't be tempted
  to use ready-prepared tomato puree instead of fresh.
  
  The spice combinations in garam masala vary in different parts of
  India. In the Punjab this one which you can try making yourself is
  common: 5 tbsps coriander seeds, 3 tbsps cumin seeds, 2 1/2 tbsps
  black peppercorns, 2 1/2 black cardamom seeds, 2 in cinnamon stick,
  4-5 cloves, 1/6 nutmeg. Put the coriander and the cumin into a
  cast-iron frying-pan over a medium heat. Stir until lightly roasted.
  Allow to cool. Grind with the remaining ingredients in a clean coffee
  grinder and store in a tightly lidded jar.
  
  Madhur Jaffrey's Flavours of India - Punjab
  
  This rich flavoursome dish originates in the fertile Punjab, a state
  now divided between India and Pakistan. There is nothing more
  important to a Punjabi man's diet than bread, and meals are
  accompanied by flat round cornbread rotis or rich, flaky pan-fried
  paratha layered with ghee (clarified butter).
  
  Rice is reserved for special occasions or for rice pudding, for the
  only food that makes a Punjabi feel he has eaten a proper meal is his
  bread! You of course, can serve this dish with plain boiled rice.

      Place the water, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a heavy-duty
  electric mixer (KitchenAid K5A2 model works best). Stir to dissolve
  the sugar. Add the yeast and stir to dissolve. Stir in the beaten
  eggs and the oil. Beat in 5 cups of the weighed-out flour to make a
  batter. Beat for 5 minutes or until the batter begins to pull away
  from the sides of the bowl. Knead in the remaining flour by machine
  until smooth. Place the dough on a clean countertop and cover it with
  a large metal bowl. Allow the dough to rise until double in bulk.
      Punch the dough down and allow it to rise again. Punch the dough
  down again and divide it in half. Cut each half into thirds. Roll 3
  of the pieces into ropes about 16 inches long with your hands. Join 1
  end of each rope and press together with the heel of your hand.
  Alternately, braid the 3 ropse together and press the other 3 ends
  together with the heel of your hand..
      Sprinkle a large baking sheet with a little of the cornmeal.
  Place the braided dough on the sheet pan and allow it to double in
  bulk again. Repeat the process with the remaining dough. Allow the
  dough to rise until double in bulk.
      Beat the 2 egg yolks and 1 tablespoon of water together for the
  egg wash. Lightly brush both risen braided doughs. Sprinkle with
  sesame seeds.

  proofs, add rest of the sugar, butter/margerine, 3 lightly beaten
  eggs, and five cups flour.  As your stir together, add salt (done
  this way because salt can kill yeast if added directly). Beat
  ingredients with a spoon, gradually adding flour, until dough is

    Punch down and knead dough until all the bubbles are gone. Divide
  into 6 parts, roll each part between your hands into a rope about 1"
  in diameter. Braid 3 ropes each into 2 loaves. Place two braids about
  6" apart on a buttered/margerined cookie sheet, and allow to raise in

  wash and sprinkle lightly with poppy seeds.  Bake in pre-heated 400ø

  Beat the eggs together with cream, half-and-half, or milk. Beat in
  cinnamon and salt. Melt the butter in a large frying pan. Dip the
  challah slices, one at a time, into the egg mixture, making sure that
  each slice is well coated. The challah should absorb a little of the
  egg mixture but not enough to get soggy. Fry each battered challah
  slice for 2-3 minutes on each side until they are golden brown. Don't
  fry too fast or the inside will be wet and gooey. Serve with your
  favorite jam, maple syrup, honey, cinnamon, sugar, or plain. NOTE:
  Heavy cream really is the best liquid to use in this recipe.

  2 1/4 c  Water
      1 tb Yeast (active),

    1/4 c  Oil
      2    Eggs, beaten
     10 c  Flour (or less)
      1    Egg yolk
      1 tb Water
 
  Dissolve the yeast and sugar in lukewarm water (105 degrees F.).
  (Lukewarm water feels neither hot nor cold when a drop is placed on
  your wrist.) Let sit for 10 minutes to proof the yeast. If there are
  no bubbles in the water after this time, the yeast is inactive and
  you should start over with new yeast.
  
  Add the salt (optional), oil, eggs and most of the flour to the 2 1/4
  cups of water. Mix. Place dough on floured board and knead for 5-10
  minutes.
  
  Place dough in a clean bowl, brush some oil on the top (optional) and
  cover the bowl with a towel.  Let rise in a warm place until doubled,
  about 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Punch the dough down and let rise until doubled again (maybe another
  hour).
  
  Punch dough down and place onto floured board.  Form into two loaves.
  You can make normal loaves, or you can cut the dough and braid (with
  three or six pieces per loaf), or you can make braided or un-braided
  rolls, or you can roll the dough out until it's about 1/4 inch thick
  and then spread fried onions over it. Place loaves into oiled pans.
  
  Cover pans and let rise for about 30 minutes.  (Skip this step if
  you've rolled the dough out and covered with onions.)
  
  Mix the egg yolk with about 1 tablespoon of water. Brush loaves with
  this mixture.  (Again, skip this if you've rolled the dough out.)
  Bake at 400 degrees F. for 20 minutes, then lower heat to 350 degrees
  F. and bake for 40 additional minutes. If you are making rolls, you
  probably need to bake for a total of 20-25 minutes.
  
  You can add poppy or sesame seeds to the dough, or you can sprinkle
  the seeds on top. This bread is traditionally made with white flour,
  but is still good if made with all or part whole wheat flour. I think
  its good taste comes from the oil and eggs in the dough.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Challah is a traditional Jewish bread that is part of many
  festivals, including sabbath dinners and weddings. For making a
  wedding loaf, this recipe can be doubled and used to make one braided
  loaf. It will fill up the entire oven, and you will have to find a
  cookie sheet big enough to put the loaf on. Yield: 2 loaves.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, as bread goes.
  : Time:  preparation:  3-5 hours (including rising); baking: 1 hour.
  : Precision:  measure ingredients carefully.

  NOTES:
  
  *  Jewish egg bread -- This is my family's version of Challah. It
  calls for saffron, but I've never actually made it as such (Hey, I'm
  just a poor college student, I can't afford saffron).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, if you know how to make bread
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours rising, 30 minutes
  cooking : Precision:  Raisins are to taste. Measure the rest of the

MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
    1/2 oz Yeast (active),
           -dry (2 packages)
      2 c  Water, warm
      4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Sugar, granulated
      3 lg Eggs
    3/4 c  Vegetable oil
           -(up to about 1/4 cup
           -more, to taste)
      9 c  Flour, all-purpose
           -(more if needed)

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
      1 lg Egg
           Sesame or poppy seeds
 
  Mix yeast in warm water.  Let sit 5 minutes.  In a large bowl combine
  salt, sugar, eggs and oil.  Add yeast mixture. Slowly add flour,
  stirring until not too sticky. When the dough becomes too thick to
  stir, turn it out onto a floured board and knead, adding flour as
  necessary. Scrape the working surface with a plastic dough spatula
  from time to time, to keep a dry skin from forming on it.  You may
  find that you need more flour, but don't add too much more, or the
  dough will become heavy. Knead until the dough is smooth and elastic
  (about 10 minutes).
  
  Form dough into a ball and place in a lightly oiled large bowl,
  turning to coat the dough with oil.  A ceramic bowl is best. Cover
  the bowl with a clean cloth and leave in a warm, draft-free place to
  rise for 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in bulk. After the dough has
  risen, punch it down and divide it into 6 balls. Let the dough balls
  sit for 5 minutes, covered.
  
  Keeping dough balls covered while working, remove a ball and roll it
  between your hands (or on working surface) into a cord about 1 inch
  wide by about 20 inches long. The dough is quite elastic, making it
  nicely workable, yet also tending to make it shrink back slightly
  after being lengthened.  I find it best to lengthen it in a series of
  passes. Form 3 cords this way, and then start from the middle and
  braid them into a single loaf.  Tuck the ends under. It's a little
  harder to figure out how to start braiding from the middle, but the
  loaves come out more even and attractive that way.  Don't pull the
  cords while braiding. Place the loaf on a lightly oiled baking sheet,
  and cover it with a cloth while you form the other loaf.  Keep the
  loaves well apart on the baking sheet, since they will expand a lot.
  Cover the loaves and place again into a warm, draft-free place to
  rise for 45-60 minutes.
  
  After the loaves have risen, gently brush the tops with beaten egg
  using a soft brush, and then sprinkle with the seeds. Bake at 350
  degrees F. for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.

 Categories: Breads, Jewish
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
           See Part 1
 
  : Continued from Part 1
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Challah (pronounced "hallah") is a type of braided egg bread
  traditionally eaten on the Jewish Sabbath. It is eaten by tearing off
  hunks rather than by cutting with a knife.
  
  I got this recipe from a housemate a couple of years ago; I don't
  know its origins before that, but it has become one of my favorite
  recipes, and one with which I have experimented a good deal. I've
  tried several other challah recipes, but find I like this one the
  best. Yield: 2 Large loaves.
  
  *  The variation in oil makes quite a difference in the moisture of
  the bread: If you use the larger quantity, the bread comes out very
  nice and moist, but when it cools it becomes somewhat oily.
  
  The amounts of sugar and oil may sound high, but try it this way once
  before cutting back. I have tried other recipes that use less, and
  they don't taste nearly as good.
  
  *  Here's the fun part --> variations.  Because this dough is so
  workable, you can form it many different ways, limited only by your
  imagination; I once made a whole collection of different shapes and
  sizes, for a festive dinner party.
  
  Some of the variations I have tried include:
  
  :  o  Adding extra ingredients, such as raisins and/or nuts
  :  o  Forming the braided loaf into a wreath-like loop (joining the
  ends) :  o  Braiding 5 ways instead of 3
  :  o  Baking a small loaf on top of a larger loaf (traditional)
  :  o  Braiding 3 braided loaves into a recursive loaf (didn't turn out
  well; it ended up looking knotty, rather than intricate, and being
  somewhat tough)
  :  o  Varying the loaf sizes.  One time I made individual-sized
  loaves, so that everyone could have their own loaf at dinner. Another
  time, I divided the dough into 2 halves, set one aside, and made a
  loaf out of the other half. Then, I divided the remaining piece into
  2 halves, and continued the process until I had an array of loaves,
  each half the size of the previous. I managed to get 9 loaves by
  doing this, the smallest of which was about 1/4 inch by about 2
  inches.
  
  :  o  Varying the length-to-width proportions; traditionally, challah
  loaves are quite wide relative to their length. I find that shorter,
  wider loaves are doughier (and thus tastier), but longer loaves look
  more elegant.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes dough preparation, 1 1/2 hours first rising, 1
  hour loaf forming, 1 hour second rising, 30 minutes baking. Total: 4
  1/2 hours. : Precision: Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: CHALLAH OR KOILITCH+
 Categories: Breads, Jewish, Heirloom
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 pk Yeast
      1 tb Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Tepid water
  4 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 tb All-purpose flour
      2 ts Salt
      2    Eggs, lightly beaten
      2 tb Butter, melted
      1    Egg yolk
           Poppy seeds
 
  Method: Combine the yeast and sugar in the mixing bowl of a table top
  mixer and dissolve in 1-1/4 cup tepid water.  In a large mixing bowl,
  sift together the flour and the salt.  Add the eggs and melted and
  cooled butter and 2/3 of the flour mixture to the yeast mixture.  Mix
  at speed 2 for 2 minutes, then add the flour up to the point that the
  dough leaves the sides of the bowl.  Grease large bowl and place the
  dough in it turning to grease the top.  Cover with a kitchen towel.
  Let rise in a draftless warm place for approximately 1 hour.  Take
  2/3 of the dough and make a braid with it about 1 foot long.  Place
  it on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Put kitty-corner, squarely in
  the middle. Brush braid with the egg yolk. Take the rest of the dough
  and make a smaller braid only 10 inches long. Take the side of your
  hand and press firmly along the top of the larger braid (to keep
  smaller braid in place as it is baking). Place smaller braid on top.
  Brush the top braid with egg yolk and sprinkle liberally with poppy
  seeds.
  
  Let rise in a warm place again, about 40 minutes; don't let it rise
  too much.  Bake in preheated oven at 375 degrees F. for 40 to 45
  minutes. Check after about 25 minutes to see that it isn't getting
  too dark. If it is, place a piece of foil over it for the balance of
  the baking time. Wrap leftovers, if any, in wax paper.

      Title: CHALLAH WITH SAFFRON
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    Packages dry yeast
      5 c  Bread or all-purpose flour
      2 tb Sugar
      2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Butter or margarine,
           -room temperature
      1 c  Hot water (120-130 )
      1 pn Saffron
      3    Eggs
      1    Egg white
      1    Egg yolk beaten, mixed with
      2 tb Sugar, and
      1 ts Cold water
      1 ts Poppy seeds
      1 lg Baking sheet, greased
 
  In a large mixing bowl combine the yeast, 2 cups flour, sugar, salt,
  and butter or margarine. Gradually add the hot water and beat
  forcefully by hand or at medium speed using the mixer flat beater,
  for 2 minutes. Scrape the bowl occasionally.  Add the saffron, eggs
  and egg white (reserving the yolk). The batter will be thick. Beat at
  high speed for 2 minutes. Continue to add flour with a wooden spoon
  or change to a dough hook in the mixer. Add about 3 additional cups
  of flour, one at a time, until the rough mass is no longer sticky. If
  it continues to be moist, add small amounts of flour until the dough
  cleans the sides of the bowl.
  
  Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead until it is smooth and
  elastic, about 10 minutes.
  
  Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap
  and set aside until it has doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
  
  Remove plastic wrap, punch the dough down and knead out the bubbles.
  Divide the dough in half. To braid, divide each half into three equal
  pieces. Under your palms roll each into a 12" length. Lay the rolls
  parallel to each other. Start the braid in the middle and work to one
  end. Pinch the end securely together. Turn around and complete the
  other end. Repeat with the other dough half. Carefully brush the
  braids with the egg glaze. Sprinkle liberally with poppy seeds. Don't
  cover the braids for the second rise. They will double in bulk in
  about an hour. Preheat oven to 400 before baking. Bake until the
  braids are shiny brown, 30 to 40 minutes, and test done when a
  toothpick inserted in the center comes out dry and clean. Carefully
  remove the bread from the baking sheet and cool on wire racks. A long
  braided loaf fresh from the oven is fragile and should be moved with
  care (and a spatula under it's bottom). Do not cut until it has
  cooled and firmed a bit.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Cold water
      2 pk Dry yeast
      2 ts Salt
      6 tb Butter or Margarine
    1/2 c  Sugar (+ 1 T if desired)
      3    Eggs
      7 c  Unbleached flour (approx.)
      1    Egg yold mixed w/ 1 T water
  1 1/2 c  Golden raising (optional)
 
   In large bowl of electric mixer, thoroughly mix undissolved yeast
  with 1/3 of the flour and all other dry ingredients. In a 2 to 4 cup
  measure, start with 1 1/4 cups cold water. Add margarine, then add
  enough water to make 2 cups liquid.  Heat liquids with margarine over
  low heat unitl very warm, 110 to 120 degrees. Margarine does not need
  to melt. Add liquids to dry ingredients.  Beat for 2 minutes at
  medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add about
  1/2 cup flour, or enough flour to make a thick batter. Add the 3 eggs
  one at a time. Beat on high speed for 2 minutes, scraping bowl
  occasionally. Use dough hook or wooden spoon to stir, adding all but
  one cup of flour or as much as is needed to make elastic dough.
  Amount will vary according to temperature and humidity of room.  If
  raisins are used, add here and stir thoroughly. Turn dough out on
  floured surface, kneading until it becomes smooth and satiny to the
  touch. Add more flour if needed. Place dough in well-greased bowl,
  turning to grease top of dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise
  until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Punch down. Return to
  lightly floured board. Cut into desired amount of loaves. This recipe
  makes 1 very large, 2 large or 3 medium loaves. Cut amount of dough
  desired. Stretch into one strand and twist to form a crown.
  Paint egg mixture. Repeat with remaining dough. Tops may be sprinkled
  with sesame or poppy seeds. After bread has risen for about an hour,
  brush any dry areas with egg wash. Prick any air bubbles. Bake in
  375-degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until browned. A flick of
  finger should produce a hollow sound. Remove to rack to cool. Challah
  freezes well but should be thoroughly cooled before wrapping in heavy
  foil.

  NOTES:
  
  *  A Mexican meat and bean dish, similar to chili -- I got this
  recipe from "A Primer on Bean Cookery" by the California Dry Bean
  Advisory Board. While not a true chili, chalupa is a Mexican-American
  favorite for a hearty lunch or supper. It may be made ahead and
  reheated, and it freezes well.
  
  *  Chili powder is a mixture of spices, consisting mainly of ground
  dried chili peppers.  This recipe may be served with corn chips and
  condiments (including chopped tomato, chopped avocado, chopped onion,
  shredded lettuce, grated cheddar cheese and hot sauce).

 Categories: Entrees, Tex-mex
      Yield: 12 Chalupas
 
           Vegetable oil
     12    Corn tortillas (the
           -thinner the better)
      6 c  Frijoles refritos
           -(or less)
    1/2 lb Cheddar cheese
           -(sharp), grated
      1 lg Tomato, chopped
      3 c  Lettuce, shredded
 
  In a small skillet, heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil. Test the
  oil for proper temperature by putting in a small piece of tortilla.
  When the oil reaches the temperature where it immediately begins to
  bubble frantically over the tortilla as soon as it is put in the oil
  and the tortilla piece becomes crisp quite quickly, you are ready to
  cook the chalupa shells. This is important because there is nothing
  worse than a soggy chalupa shell which results from the oil not being
  hot enough.
  
  Fry tortillas completely flat on both sides until very crisp. Drain
  and keep warm on a newspaper-covered cookie sheet in a warm oven.
  
  Spread about 1/4-inch thick layer of refried beans on each fried
  tortilla. Top with a generous amount of grated sharp Cheddar cheese
  and about 1 T chopped onion.
  
  Place assembled chalupas on a cookie sheet and brown under broiler
  until cheese melts.  Watch them carefully under the broiler, they can
  burn quite quickly.  Top with shredded lettuce and tomato and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Tex-Mex style tostada -- You will need to first make a batch of
  frijoles refritos.  This dish is more properly known in Mexico as
  tostadas.

  "If you pick up a half-dozen herb books to look up chamomile, you are
  likely to find a bewilderment of names. There's Roman (or English)
  chamomile, a perennial, and German (or Hungarian) chamomile, an
  annual. The German species might be listed as Matricaria chamomile,
  Chamomilla recutita, or Matricaria recutita. These are all the same
  plant! Roman chamomile is referred to in some sources as Anthemis
  nobilis, in others as Chamaemelum nobile. The currently accepted
  nomenclature is Matricaria recutita for the German, and Chamaemelum
  nobile for the Roman.

  pronounced with a long i), is derived from Greek - chamos (ground)
  and melos (apple), referring to the fact that the plant grows low to
  the ground, and the fresh blooms have a pleasing apple scent. Even at
  this level of naming, all is not clear.  Roman chamomile is indeed
  low growing, and is used for clipped lawns in England.  But German
  chamomile grows to a relatively stately 2 1/2 feet.
  
                           - Telling Them Apart -
  
  "German chamomile is a sweet-scented, branching plant whose tiny
  leaves are twice-divided into thin linear segments. The flowers, up
  to one inch across, have a hollow, cone-shaped receptacle, with tiny
  yellow disk flowers covering the cone.  The cone is surrounded by 10
  to 20 white, down-curving ray flowers, giving it the appearance of a
  miniature daisy. German chamomile is native to Europe and Western
  Asia, where it is weedy; it has escaped from cultivation in the
  United States as well."
  
  "Roman chamomile...has a spreading habit and grows only about a foot
  high. Leaves are twice or thrice divided into linear segments, which
  are flatter and thicker than those of German chamomile. Its flowers
  are also up to an inch across, but its disk is a broader conical
  shape, and the receptacle is solid. Roman chamomile also has white
  ray flowers, though a number of cultivated varieties have none at all
  and give the appearance of little yellow buttons.  There are also
  double-flowered cultivars (well-known by the sixteenth century), and
  a flowerless one called 'Treneague,' named for the English estate on
  which it was developed. Roman chamomile is native to Western Europe
  northward to Northern Ireland.
  
  "If you have a pile of dried chamomile flowers, you can distinguish
  the Roman from the German by splitting the flower receptacle open
  down the middle.  If the receptacle is solid, it is Roman; if hollow,
  it is German. You should test five or ten flowers to be sure, because
  occasionally a German chamomile flower will be solid in the interior.
  Roman chamomile has slightly hairy stems, while those of the German
  are smooth. In the live plant, the flowers of Roman chamomile sit
  singly atop the stem, while those of the German are on divided stems
  in a comb-like arrangement (known as a corymb)."

      Title: CHAMOMILE INFORMATION II/II
 Categories: Seasonings, Info
      Yield: 1 Info below
 
      1    Info below
 
                       - Chamomile for Your Health -
  
  "In Europe, chamomile is highly esteemed as a medicinal herb.
  Matricaria recutita is included in the pharmacopoeias of 26
  countries. Writing on the plant in the Australian journal _Focus on
  Herbs_, Slovakian chamomile expert Ivan Salamon quoted a common folk
  saying of his country: 'An individual should always bow before the
  creative powers of the chamomile plant.'  And 'As a popular remedy,
  it may be thought of as the European counterpart of ginseng,' Dr.
  Varro Tyler wrote in _The New Honest Herbal_. Dr. Tyler tells us that
  the Germans describe it as alles zutraut ~ 'capable of anything.'
  
  "Are these statements just overenthusiasm, or is there meaning behind
  the folklore?  Indeed, German chamomile, and to a lesser extent, Roman
  chamomile, is among the best-researched medicinal herbs now used in
  Europe. There it is used in a wide variety of ways and in dozens of
  products: compresses, rinses, or gargles are used externally for the
  treatment of inflammations and irritations of the skin, mouth, gums,
  and respiratory tract, and for hemorrhoids.  A chamomile bath - a
  pound of flowers to 20 gallons of water - is also used.
  (Alternatively, alcohol extracts of the flowers are available in
  Europe - a much more convenient way to take a chamomile bath!)
  
  "Internally, a tea made from 2 to 3 grams of the herb to a cup of
  water is used to relieve spasms and inflammations of the intestinal
  tract, as well as for peptic ulcers. (Remember that there are about
  28 grams in an ounce, so this is a very mild tea.)  A mild tea is
  also used as a sleeping aid, particularly for children. These
  medicinal uses, cited in a monograph developed by the European
  Scientific Cooperative for Phytomedicine, are backed by intensive
  research of recent years as well as many centuries of common use."
  
  "Over the last decade, the popular press and even medical literature
  in the United States have reported that drinking chamomile tea may
  cause severe allergic reactions. The basis for this, according to Dr.
  Tyler, is 50 allergic reactions resulting from 'chamomiles' reported
  between 1887 and 1982.  Of these, only five were attributed to German
  chamomile. I think this says more about its safety than it does any
  potential harm; nonetheless, persons who experience allergic
  reactions to ragweed or other members of the aster family are warned
  that they should use chamomile with caution.
  
  "German chamomile has highly variable chemistry.  To date, more than
  120 chemical components have been identified from its clear blue
  essential oil. For many years, chamazulene was thought to be the
  primary active component, but scientists now believe that any
  antiinflammatory, antispasmodic, antimicrobial, and mildly sedative
  effect is due to one called bisabolol. Since the late 1970s and
  1980s, European plant breeders, producers, chemists, and
  pharmacologists have been working on programs to improve the plant.
  Today, they recognize four basic chemical types of German chamomile,
  which has led to the production of higher-quality chamomile with more
  stable, predictable constituents and higher levels of active
  components. Crop improvement programs are continuing in both eastern
  and western Europe."

      3 ea Chicken breast/boned/skinned
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Champagne; dry
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      3 tb Tarragon; fresh (1 t dry)
      1 x  Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1 x  ----optional ingredients----
      6 ea Prosciutto slices/paper thin
      3 ea Shallots; finely chopped
      1 tb Butter or margarine
 
  *** See instructions at end if using the optional ingredients. Cut
  chicken into 1/4" wide slices. Melt the butter and olive oil in a
  large heavy skillet. Saute the chicken for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the
  chicken and keep warm. Deglaze the pan with the champagne. Add the
  cream to the pan. Add the tarragon and reduce the sauce for two
  minutes. Put the chicken back into the pan and bring just to a
  simmer. Remove to serving platter. Serve hot with fresh vegetables or
  over rice or pasta. (I serve this over fettucini, or with a side dish
  of Fettucini Alfredo). *** Cut chicken breasts in half only. Place
  each half between sheets of waxed paper and pound with a meat
  tenderizer until about 1/8" thick. Saute shallots in butter until
  tender. Divide shallots equally between the breast halves, spreading
  evenly over each. Place one slice of prosciutto on each breast half,
  fold in half, and secure with toothpicks. Saute about 4 to 5 minutes
  on each side in the butter and olive oil listed in the original
  ingredients. Chicken is done when it springs back when lightly
  pressed with finger. Follow the balance of the instructions listed
  above for the sauce. Source: The original recipe came from "The
  Martha Culbertson Cook Booklet" published by Culbertson Winery. The
  "additional ingredients" modification is my own.

 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------CENTER MIXTURE----------------------------
      8 oz Cream
      1 lb Bittersweet chocolate
      1 oz Butter
      1 oz Cognac

MMMMM--------------------------ENROBING-------------------------------
      1 lb Bittersweet chocolate
      1 lb Cocoa
 
  It is important to use an excellent quality chocolate when making
  truffles since it is the primary ingredient. Valhrona is my first
  choice and Callebaut is my second. BRING THE CREAM TO A BOIL and pour
  it over the cut chocolate. Allow to stand 1-to-2 minutes and stir
  smooth. Beat in the softened butter and cool to set. Beat with an
  electric mixer (using a paddle attachment if available) on medium
  speed until light. Beat in Cognac. Pipe out small truffles on
  parchment or waxed paper with a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch
  plain tube. Refrigerate to set. Melt the chocolate. Sift the cocoa
  into a deep pan. Dip the truffles in the melted chocolate and then
  deposit them in the cocoa, shaking the pan to cover them. After the
  covering sets, shake the truffles in a strainer to remove the excess
  cocoa.

           -use stewing beef)
      2    Scallions
      3    Cloves garlic
      1 c  Beef broth
      1 c  Soy sauce
    1/3    - 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
           -dash black pepper
 
  1) Place meat in a pot and cover with cold water. Bring to boil,
  skimming froth.  Simmer 2 hours. Remove meat from liquid and reduce
  to 1 cup (or use canned broth and save this broth for something
  else). Cool meat, then slice into pieces approx. 1 1/2 in. x 1 in. 2)
  Coarsely chop scallions and smash and chop garlic. Place meat slices
  into pan with scallions, garlic, beef stock and soy sauce and bring
  to boil. Add cayenne and black pepper. Simmer 5 mins. 3) Remove pan
  from heat and cool. Place contents in a container and refrigerate
  (the fat will rise to the top and harden and can be easily removed).
  This meat will keep indefinitely, but it's pretty tasty, so that's
  not a problem with this small amount. I think this is the kind of
  thing that is good to have on hand in the fridge to snack on (with
  some rice and kimchee, of course) or as part of a simple meal.

           -shrimp paste
      8    Ounces extra-thin rice
           -vermicelli
 
  The allied recipes for this rather complex operation follow in the
  next post. Although this dish can be baked in an oven, I strongly
  suggest you grill it over charcoal, for the result is far superior.
  The dish may be prepared over 2 consecutive days.  On day one,
  prepare the dipping sauce and condiments.  The Vegetable Platter and
  shrimp paste can be assembled the following day. Fresh sugar cane may
  be obtained at Caribbean markets; canned sugar cane is available at
  Asian grocery stores. Prepare the roasted rice powder, scallion oil,
  crisp-fried shallots and roasted peanuts. Set aside. Shell and devein
  the shrimp. Sprinkle the salt over the shrimp and let stand for 20
  minutes. Rinse the shrimp thoroughly with cold water. Drain and
  squeeze between your hands to remove excess water. Dry thoroughly
  with paper towels.  Coarsely chop the shrimp. Boil the pork fat for
  10 minutes. Drain and finely dice. In a food processor, combine the
  shrimp, garlic, shallots and sugar. Process until the shrimp paste
  pulls away from the sides of the container, stopping as necessary to
  scrape down the sides. The paste should be very fine and sticky. Add
  the pork fat, roasted rice powder, fish sauce and black pepper to
  taste to the processor. Pulse briefly, only enough to blend all of
  the ingredients. Cover and refrigerate. Meanwhile, prepare the Peanut
  Sauce and Vegetable Platter. Cover the rice papers with a damp towel
  and a sheet of plastic wrap; keep at room temperature until needed.
  Peel the fresh sugar cane; cut crosswise into 4-inch sections. Split
  each section lengthwise into quarters. (if using canned sugar cane,
  split each section lengthwise in half only, then thread 2 pieces
  lengthwise onto a skewer.) Pour about 1/4 cup of oil into a small
  bowl. Oil your fingers. Pick up and mold about 2 tablespoons of the
  shrimp paste around and halfway down a piece of fresh sugar cane.
  Leave about 1 1/2 inches of the sugar cane exposed to serve as a
  handle. (If using canned sugar cane, there is no need to leave a
  handle. The skewers will serve as handles.) Press firmly so that the
  paste adheres to the cane. Proceed until you have used all the shrimp
  paste. Prepare a charcoal grill or preheat the oven to broil.
  Meanwhile, steam the noodles, then garnish with the scallion oil,
  crisp-fried shallots and ground roasted peanuts. Keep warm.  Pour the
  peanut sauce into individual bowls and place the Vegetable Platter
  and rice papers on the table. Grill the shrimp paste on the sugar
  cane over medium coals, turning frequently. Or Broil, on a baking
  sheet lined with foil, under the broiler, about 6 inches from the
  heat, for 3 minutes on each side, or until browned. Transfer to a
  warm platter. To serve, each diner dips a rice paper round in a bowl
  of warm water to make it pliable, then places the paper on a dinner
  plate. Different ingredients from the Vegetable Platter, some noodles
  and a piece of the shrimp paste, which has been removed from the
  sugar cane, are added. The rice paper is then roiled up to form a
  neat package. The roll is dipped in the Peanut Sauce and eaten out of
  hand. The remaining sugar cane may be chewed. Note: If both types of
  sugar cane are unavailable, use skewers. Shape the shrimp paste into
  meatballs and thread 3 or 4 on each skewer. Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

      Title: CHAO TOM (SHRIMP & SUGAR CANE ROLLS)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Shrimp, shelled and deveined
      2 ts Salt
      2    Garlic cloves
      2    Shallots
      2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Black pepper
      1 tb Toasted rice powder
      1 tb Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc

           Three 6-inch long canned
           -sugar cane sections
      1    Cucumber, peeled and cut

      1 c  Fresh mint leaves
      1 c  Fresh coriander leaves
           Twelve butter or red leaf
           -lettuce leaves
           Twelve 8-inch round dried
           -rice papers

MMMMM-----------------------DIPPING SAUCE----------------------------
      4    Garlic cloves
      2    Fresh Serrano chiles
      2 tb Sugar
      6 tb Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc
           -man)
      4 tb Fresh lime juice
      6    To 8 tablespoons water
 
  The Vietnamese use a small indoor earthen stove fueled with coal set
  on the table to simmer, boil and barbecue. I have broiled this dish
  in an oven, with excellent results. Sugar cane makes this recipe
  visually exciting and exotic.  Its sweetness subtly melts into the
  shrimp paste. Sugar cane comes fresh and canned in better Asian
  markets; the former is scarce and very expensive.  Check with the
  grocery clerk to make certain that you are buying the 6- to 7-inch
  long stalks, not the cubes. The recipe serves well as a buffet
  appetizer or as a first course for a dinner party.
  
  Shell and devein the shrimp.  Toss with salt; let sit for 10 minutes.
  Rinse with cold water; drain thoroughly. Blot dry. In a food
  processor, finely mince the garlic and shallots.  Add sugar, pepper,
  toasted rice powder, fish sauce, and shrimp; process into a smooth
  paste.
  
  With the machine running, pour the ice water through the feed tube;
  process until the shrimp is light and fluffy. Cover and refrigerate.
  Pour vegetable oil into a small bowl. Place a wire cooling rack on a
  baking sheet; brush with oil.
  
  Cut the sugar cane lengthwise into quarters to make 12 long strips.
  Dip your fingers into the oil, then take about 2 tablespoons shrimp
  paste and evenly mold a 1-inch cylinder around a sugar cane strip,
  leaving 1 inch free at both ends.
  
  Arrange the rolls on the rack diagonally, and keep them from touching
  each other.
  
  Arrange the cucumber, mint and coriander leaves, and lettuce on a
  platter; set aside.
  
  Broil the shrimp rolls about 6 inches from the heat, turning once,
  until the edges are bright orange and the filling feels firm to the
  touch, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
  
  To serve, take a rice paper sheet and set it on a plate. Dip a pastry
  brush into a bowl of water. Brush the entire rice paper generously
  with water.
  
  Let it sit until the paper is pliable and somewhat flimsy. Put a
  lettuce leaf on one end of the paper.
  
  Place a cucumber sliver, mint and coriander leaves on top of the
  lettuce.
  
  Take a hot stick of sugar cane, break off the shrimp and place it on
  top of the vegetables.  Begin rolling up the paper to enclose the
  filling; form it into the shape of a cylinder. Drip into the nuoc
  Cham Dipping Sauce,. and take a bite, then chew on the sugar cane for
  the sweetness (do not swallow the sugar cane).
  
  NUOC CHAM DIPPING SAUCE: Grind the garlic, chiles and sugar into a
  paste in a mortar, blender or mini-food processor. Stir in fish
  sauce, lime and water.  Strain into a dipping bowl.
  
  NOTE:  If sugar cane is not available, use a skewer or inexpensive
  bamboo chopsticks.  Soak them in water overnight before wrapping with
  shrimp paste.
  
  Makes 12 rolls or serves 6.

  Note: As the rolled out chappatis will dry out if they are left stand
  while cooking other,  it is advantageous to roll them out
  individually before cooking them.
  
  At step 9, the top should just start to look dry and small bubbles to
  form.

      Title: CHAPATIS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Flour, unbleached
    1/2 c  Flour, whole wheat
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Ghi
    1/2 c  ;water
 
  Mix flours, salt, and butter and add just enough water to make a firm
  dough, somewhat like a biscuit dough. Knead for 10-15 minutes - the
  more the dough is kneaded, the lighter the bread will be. Shape the
  dough into a ball, cover with a sheet of plastic and let it rest for
  at least 1 hour. If left to rest overnight in the refrigerator, the
  finished bread will be even lighter. When ready to bake, take a small
  piece of dough about the size of a golf ball, or a bit smaller. On a
  lightly floured board, roll the dough into a thin circle, about 5
  inches in diameter. Repeat with all the dough. Heat a griddle or
  heavy-bottomed iron skillet until it is very hot (you will notice the
  smoke rising from it). Place the rolled out chapati on the griddle
  and let it cook for 2-3 minutes, depending on how thin you have
  rolled it. Using a pair of kitchen tongs, you can lift the chapati to
  see if the underside has turned a golden brown. Flip, and cook the
  other side about 1 minute. As they are cooked, store the chapatis on
  a towel in a warm covered container until ready to serve. Serve as
  soon as the last chapati is baked. NOTE: In India breads sometimes
  are baked in the fiery clay tandoor, where they develop brown spots
  and bubbles. To achieve a similar effect at home, you can use tongs
  to hold each chapati over a hot gas flame until it puffs like a
  little balloon.  The chapati will collapse as it cools.

      2 c  Whole Wheat Flour
      1 ts Salt
    2/3 c  Water
 
  Yield:  12 Chapatis Cooking Time: 2 Minutes Each
  
  Put the flour and salt into a bowl.  Add the water and mix to a stiff
  dough; knead well until the dough feels firm and elastic. Then place
  in a greased plastic bag or in grease proof paper and leave in a warm
  place for 30 minutes.  Turn onto a floured board, shape the dough
  into a long roll, and divide into 12 equal slices. Roll out paper
  thin. Heat the heavy frying pan and when very hot, cook the chapatis
  for not more than one minute on either side.  Cool in a tea towel.
  Chapatis should always be cooked fresh for each meal.
  
  NOTE:
  
  To cook them, you can use an ungreased heavy frying pan, griddle,
  bakestone or solid plate.
  
  Left-over chapatis make an attractive crispbread when dried off in a
  cool oven.

  Soak the Chinese mushrooms in 1 cup hot water for 20 minutes. When
  they have softened, cut off the hard stems and slice the caps fine.
  Drop the spinach into 10 cups of boiling water. Boil rapidly for 2
  minutes. Drain. Run under cold water.  Squeeze out as much moisture
  as possible. Peel the carrot, cut into 3 sections and then into fine
  julienne strips. Wipe off the fresh mushrooms and break off their
  stems. Cut the caps into very fine slices.  Cut the nonwoody part of
  the stems into matchstick pieces. Cut away and discard the curly,
  tender part of the cabbage leaves. Save only the V-shaped core of the
  leaves. Cut this into julienne strips. Cut the scallions into
  2-1/2-inch sections.  Quarter the section with the bulb lengthwise.
  Combine the Chinese mushrooms, spinach, carrot, zucchini, mushrooms,
  cabbage, and scallions in a bowl. Mix well, separating all the
  spinach leaves. Heat the vegetable oil and the sesame oil in a wok or
  a 10-inch saute pan over a medium-high flame.  When hot, put in the
  garlic. Stir and fry for 10 seconds. Add all the vegetables in the
  bowl. Stir and fry for 3 to 4 minutes or until the vegetables are

      1 ts Salt
      3 ea Whole hot chilies
    1/8 ts Asafetida
      3 ea Sprigs fresh coriander
      2 c  Stock
 
  Place eggplant into the bottom of a heavy pot. Sprinkle in the fresh
  peas, dot with ghee & add the remaining ingredients. Bring the liquid
  to a boil & cook for 4 minutes.  Reduce the heat to low, partially
  cover & cook for about 30 minutes, shaking the pot from time to time
  to prevent sticking. If the stock is evaporating too quickly, add
  some more & reduce the heat. When almost all the stock has
  evaporated, add the frozen peas (if you are using them instead of
  fresh) reduce the heat further & fry until a crust has begun to form
  on the bottom of the pot & the eggplant has begun to char.
  
  Remove from the heat & let sit for 3 to 4 minutes. Gently stir in the
  crust & serve immediately.

      Title: CHAR SHU (ROAST PORK)
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Water
      6 tb Sugar
      1 tb Salt
    1/2 c  Dark soy sauce
    1/4 c  Rice wine
      1 cl Garlic
      3 sl Ginger root
      3 lb Pork -- butt, shoulder,
           Tenderloin
 
  PREPARATION:
  
  Heat water and add sugar and salt, stirring until melted. Remove from
  stove.  Add soy sauce and rice wine. Smash, peel, and mince garlic,
  and add to the soy sauce mixture. Peel and mince ginger root and add.
  Mix well. Place meat in a bowl and pour the mixture over it. If meat
  is not completely covered, you will need to turn it frequently as it
  marinates. Allow it to stand in the refrigerator for 48 hours. (You
  can cheat and make the marinating time shorter -- never shorter than
  6 hours -- but the longer the time, the more the meat will tenderize
  and absorb the fine flavor.) Pour off marinade, but do not wipe meat.
  Place the meat on a rack in a baking pan.
  
  COOKING:
  
  Heat oven to 450-degrees.  Bake the meat for 10 minutes. Reduce heat
  to 250-degrees and bake for 30 minutes. Turn meat over and bake for
  another 30 minutes.

  over 3 cups flour in bowl and stir until smooth.  Add more flour

  prevent condensation).  Cover and steam for 12 minutes, then enjoy!

  Mix all A ingredients thoroughly in a bowl to form filling for buns.
  Mix dry yeast with water and add to flour. Add other B ingredients
  and knead into a soft dough. After dough is well kneaded, place in
  floured bowl and cover.  Allow dough to rise for 1 hour in a warm
  place. When dough has risen, knead it again on a flour-sprinkled
  board and roll it into a long sausage. Cut sausage into 1-inch
  lengths, flatten these pieces, and roll each out to the size of a
  saucer to form wrapping. Put 1 tablespoon of filling in center of
  each wrapping, flute edges of wrapping, bring egdes together to form
  a sack, and seal by giving a slight twist and pinching with thumb and
  forefinger. Place buns in steamer rack on a wet cloth and steam for
  15 to 20 minutes. Note: Leftover buns may be served after reheating,
  either by steaming or frying. The filling (A) may also be fried to
  produce an altogether different and delightful flavor. Source; Mrs.
